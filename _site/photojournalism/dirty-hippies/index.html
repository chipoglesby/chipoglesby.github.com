<meta name="description" content="Widespread played their last two shows at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Charlotte and there were a lot of different “types” of people there.  This was one of the more interesting characters.  Apparently, this guy lost his shoe at some point during Friday nights concert and was wanting to know if anyone had seen it.  He was also taking up a collection to buy himself another “shoe”.  So my question is, Why is your one shoe still so new?  The laces haven’t even been taken out yet?  

Another interesting character was a mother and her daughter who sported a sandwich sign that said “give me money to get my deadbeat daddy out of jail.”  Righttt….if he’s in jail, why are you at a panic show collecting money?  Why don’t you have a job?  I’ve got two, can’t you get one?  Any who…
