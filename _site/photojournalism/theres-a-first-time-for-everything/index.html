<title>There's a first time for everything &#8211; Chip Oglesby</title>
<meta name="description" content="I’ve been in Columbia for two months now, and I’ve been trying to go out and shoot on my own.  The hard part is, it use to be so easy to approach people to photograph them when I was working as a photojournalist for a newspaper, I had a reason.  But now, it’s harder to approach people as an ordinary photojournalist, just an average joe with a camera.  It seems that there are more questions raised now, “what are you doing here?” “why?” “who are you photographing” and of course as always “take my picture!!”  A friend of mine and I are thinking about starting http://www.heytakemypicture.com for all those moments :)  

So I decided to that this weekend was a great weekend to go out and photograph events.  My first event was the Cop doughnut eating contest, but it didn’t start until one o’clock, so I headed for the First Lady’s Walk For Life.  Little did I know that it would turn out to be important that I went to this event.  After that, I headed back to the set of the new Kevin Bacon movie “Death Sentence” and photographed some action there with Brett, after that it was off to work.  The photo that I post today is my favorite photo from today, I like how the legs on the right hand side frame in the women in the back of the picture, I thought it was nice and had more of my personal vision in it. To make a long story short, a different shot that I took ended up running as the Metro Centerpiece.  I know that this might not be big news, but I would like to see the look on five people’s faces as they see my photograph monday morning at their office.  

Here’s the link to the article that ran in today’s paper http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/15705301.htm with the photo that did run in the paper.  It’s not my greatest, but it is a straight-forward documentay image, and that’s about it.  Until next time, enjoy!
