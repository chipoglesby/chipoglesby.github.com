        <p>2013 has been one roller coaster of a year.</p>

<p>It started in January one morning when I was at the South Carolina home. A friend called to ask me if I heard that Rick Stilwell was in a wreck and if I knew if he was okay?</p>

<p>I didn’t know that would be the day that I would lose a close friend and mentor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chipoglesby.com/2013/01/in-memory-of-rick-stilwell/">Rick’s passing was very hard on a lot of people and drew a lot of us closer together. We all gathered at his funeral to pay our respects.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.chipoglesby.com/2013/01/in-memory-of-rick-stilwell/">Now we all remember him through his memories and online presence; facebook, twitter, and stickers that we all carry with us. #livelikerick</a></p>

<p>In February I packed my small U-haul up and headed back to the mountains of Western North Carolina.</p>

<p>As I said goodbye to Columbia, there was peace in my heart. My little home of six years had served me well, but I would always miss my friends.</p>

<p>After arriving in Asheville, I settled into a job that would always be remembered as one of the worst work environments I had ever been in.</p>

<p>Only a few days after starting in March, I got a call from my sister “Dad is in the hospital and it doesn’t look good.”</p>

<p>To understand how emotional this was for me, you would have to know that my dad was in and out of hospitals for a good part of my life. He also never told us until he would get out that he had actually been in the hospital. Frustrating, right?</p>

<p>My dad told me earlier in the year that he was worried I would be upset that he couldn’t make it to the wedding, but he didn’t know how to tell me.</p>

<p>I already knew he wasn’t going to be able to make it and reassured him I wasn’t worried.</p>

<p>My dad passed on March 12th and his funeral was later the next week.</p>

<p>During that time, I<a href="http://www.chipoglesby.com/2013/04/were-married/"> got married to the love of my life</a>. That was the happiest day of my adult life. During that time, I was constantly reminding myself,</p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; "Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning." Psalm 30:5
&gt; 
&gt; 
</blockquote>

<p>Overweight, depressed and miserable, I left my awful job in the middle of June. I had enough.</p>

<p>I am so thankful to have my wife in my life. She has always been my biggest champion and she gives me so much strength and courage. I don’t think I would have made it without her.</p>

<p>In July at my churches small group, a friend of mine introduced me to someone who would give me a new chance at redemption. His name was Matt.</p>

<p>Matt owns a <a href="http://www.fastpivot.com">small web company</a> and he offered me a job. It would be a great time of healing and growing personally and professionally.</p>

<p>I understand now the bible verse that says “What was meant for your harm, God will use to your advantage.”</p>

<p>My first job served its purpose and when it was time for me to leave, that’s what I did. Now I am so much better off.</p>

<p>As I sit and think about all that has happened in 2013, I get both excited and nervous about this coming year.</p>

<p>2014 will be a year of rebuilding, rebranding, learning acceptance, growing spiritually, mentally and physically.</p>
