<p>I know that I haven’t posted photos in to my blog in a while, but that doesn’t mean I’ve given up on photography.  I’ve been really busy lately, but I hope to get back into the swing of things in 2009.  So keep coming back and keep looking for more great photos!</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>I woke up this morning and it was really nice outside.  Instead of being responsible and doing chores and laundry, I packed a towel and my camera and set out for Sullivan’s Island.  <img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nAuOZ7_4I/AAAAAAAAAQs/Zoj_tONgQD0/s400/IMG_9599.JPG" alt="" />Somewhere between Columbia and Charleston, near Holly Hill, the lines on the melting asphalt turn from dotted lines into stretchy lines of taffy that pass by my window as the sun warms my face through the sunroof of my car.  </p>

<p>One of the reasons for the trip was to test my car to see how it was holding up.  It’s a ‘95 and is pushing over 200,400 miles on it (after todays trip).  As soon as I was about to drift off while Bob Marley mellows me out, I see the first glimmer of of the low-country, a palm tree.  Soon, I see rows and rows of palm trees as I draw closer to Charleston.  After crossing the Ravenel bridge, I make a few turns and arrive at my destination, Sullivan’s Island.<a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nDxeZ7_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/e1-8z9bP6Xk/s1600-h/IMG_9596.JPG"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nDxeZ7_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/e1-8z9bP6Xk/s400/IMG_9596.JPG" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>There are two main reasons why I go to SI.  The first is being, it’s so much less crowded than Isle of Palms.  You can walk and walk and not see the tops of neon color house sticking out over the dunes like small peeps (candy) in a pile of sugar. The second reason is Poe’s Tavern.  They have the best Mahi Tacos and Yellowfin Tuna tacos.  Either one and a corona will leave you in a daze for the rest of the afternoon.  </p>

<p>After keeping my feet in the warm sand and getting a nice tan on my face, I headed to Poe’s for some dinner and then went to IOP to watch the sun set.<a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nFEuZ7_6I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Sb2mr54dcCU/s1600-h/IMG_9607.JPG"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nFEuZ7_6I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Sb2mr54dcCU/s400/IMG_9607.JPG" alt="" /></a>  There are so many times when I’ve talked about doing things and never followed through, but after spending all day yesterday thinking about consumerism, I decided to put my thoughts into action.  God made all of this beautiful land for us to enjoy and give him praise for allowing us to take shelter here, shouldn’t we get out and enjoy it?<a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nGXeZ7_7I/AAAAAAAAARE/4EYBAKM-hRY/s1600-h/IMG_9595.JPG"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nGXeZ7_7I/AAAAAAAAARE/4EYBAKM-hRY/s400/IMG_9595.JPG" alt="" /></a>The drive back seemed to be so much quicker than the drive down and I’ve often wondered why? Am I ready to get back home?  Is it because it’s night time?  Within no time, I had arrived safely at home without anyone knowing I was even gone.<br />

In the past few months, I’ve laid down my camera and it sat in my room gathering dust, only to be used on occasion.  When I was in college, my dream was to be a photographer.  It’s been hard lately, because I haven’t felt that way and I can’t figure out why.  </p>

<p>When I worked in Lancaster, I felt like I was finally learning to see.  Learning to see the world differently from most people and I’m ready to start feeling that way again.  I’m ready to push away from the computer on my days off and go out and explore the world with the passion that I use to carry in my heart.<a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDVJPssI/AAAAAAAAAOs/7xve2zaJfkA/s1600-h/IMG_8102.jpg"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDVJPssI/AAAAAAAAAOs/7xve2zaJfkA/s400/IMG_8102.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>It’s time for me to start being creative again.  </p>

<p>The reason for doing this is simple.  In the day and age of twitter, facebook, emails and all sorts of technology, it’s easy to get caught up and constantly being on the computer.  </p>

<p>It started out simply enough for me.  First came the day that I realized that I spent most of my time awake on or near a computer.  It’s what I do for a living as an online producer and that cannot be ignored.  <a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPstI/AAAAAAAAAO0/f6VoYlUnWC8/s1600-h/IMG_8233.jpg"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPstI/AAAAAAAAAO0/f6VoYlUnWC8/s400/IMG_8233.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Then I realized that instead of picking up a phone to actually contact someone, I would use email, facebook, im or twitter to reach the intended person.  I started craving the old ways of reaching people, handwritten letters and personal telephone calls.  </p>

<p>After that came the great 48 hours of “disconnect” where I spent my whole weekend away from the computer, which brings me to where I am today.<a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPsuI/AAAAAAAAAO8/gsshqKX93fw/s1600-h/IMG_8370.jpg"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPsuI/AAAAAAAAAO8/gsshqKX93fw/s400/IMG_8370.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Starting in Janurary sometime, I set a limit to no more than 15 minutes on the computer before or after work.  The one time that I do get on the computer for more than that is on Friday’s to watch LOST.  I’ve started reading more books and I’ve also started keeping a personal journal.  I now also walk three miles a day and that makes me happy :)    </p>

<p><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvD1JPsvI/AAAAAAAAAPE/s8__fIwTMTc/s1600-h/_2.jpg"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvD1JPsvI/AAAAAAAAAPE/s8__fIwTMTc/s400/_2.jpg" alt="" /></a>If you read this blog, that means one of two things.  One your a member of my family or your one of my close friends who I’ve given this link to or two, you’ve stumbled on this blog by accident or found it through some other means.    </p>

<p>I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and letting me photograph you constantly!  </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I’ve also been working on three websites.  One for SCNPA, one for a coworker and one for myself.  They are all flashed based and pretty simple to maintain, so when they’re ready to go, I’ll let you know.  Here are three screen grabs of what they look like so far.  </p>

He was also taking up a collection to buy himself another “shoe”.  So my question is, Why is your one shoe still so new?  The laces haven’t even been taken out yet?  </p>

<p>Another interesting character was a mother and her daughter who sported a sandwich sign that said “give me money to get my deadbeat daddy out of jail.”  Righttt….if he’s in jail, why are you at a panic show collecting money?  Why don’t you have a job?  I’ve got two, can’t you get one?  Any who…  </p>

I think most of the photos that I picked for my final edit came mostly from the first 30 minutes of the event, while I was there.  It’s not that the rest wasn’t important, I just know the limitations of my equipment and have to work with what I’ve got.  </p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about these signs from the event.  Even the confederate people had massed produced signs and even a website, but what does that say about the people at the march/rally?  Are home-made signs not good enough anymore?  Do they just not care?  How did protest signs even get started?  My guess is that they were used duing a “silent” protest and shortly thereafter, became the norm for everyday protest.  But what is it they’re protesting about?  Is it about the flag? War? The death of Martin Luther King?<a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ra7yCF9mcPI/AAAAAAAAAGw/7CyrORvGkRQ/s1600-h/MLK04.JPG"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ra7yCF9mcPI/AAAAAAAAAGw/7CyrORvGkRQ/s400/MLK04.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>Twas the day of Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, except Chip clicking his mouse.  Ok, so that’s about as creative as I can be right now.  It’s 1:34 am and I just got through wrapping my mom’s present. She’s easy to shop for, thankfully, just about anything gets her excited, “free rain” “a new recycling center” just about anything, so she’ll like what I got her this year, which is a jar of recycled rain!  Not really, but it will be nice.  </p>

<p>I did some other Christmas shopping recently, but since the other half of my family is in Texas, we had Christmas a little early.  </p>

<p>According to the New Yorker, around 150 billion dollars are spent on Christmas gifts annually, if you don’t own a department store yet, now would be a good time to buy one for next years gift rush.<a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RY90UKxECII/AAAAAAAAAFc/iBucM9VIjY4/s1600-h/IMG_7373.jpg"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RY90UKxECII/AAAAAAAAAFc/iBucM9VIjY4/s400/IMG_7373.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Thankfully, Christmas is on a Monday, which meant that traffic at the local mall wasn’t that bad.  To me, there’s a science that goes into buying Christmas gifts.  My secret is to listen to what people say they “need” during the summer and go ahead and buy the gift then, this so far, has worked for me.  To others, it’s the more impersonal “gift cards” which kind of say, I know you like “X” but I don’t know your taste well enough, so here’s 10 bucks.  And what in the heck is up with McDonald’s gift cards? One McNasty sandwich please!  Yet some people buy gifts based solely on the dollar amount of the gift.  500 dollar pair of sunglasses, 2,000 dollar computers and a new shiny car!  I mean, I drive a Lexus, but come on, who buys a car for Christmas?  </p>

<p>It’s interesting if you have the time to look up the story of Christmas, both in the traditional and nontraditional sense.  The wisemen brought gifts for the baby Jesus, and now we exchange gifts with loved ones, but where did it become a rat race to out do the previous year?  </p>

<p>Try this if you get a chance.  Instead of buying lots of gifts, just buy a couple, and tell someone that you “love them” or just a simple “Thank you” and enjoy your time with them, you just might like it.  And remember, our Saviour Jesus Christ was an unexpected gift for all of the world, and it didn’t cost us anything.<a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RY90h6xECJI/AAAAAAAAAFk/7cM6oQVRIxc/s1600-h/IMG_7311.jpg"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RY90h6xECJI/AAAAAAAAAFk/7cM6oQVRIxc/s400/IMG_7311.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

A call from my sister told me that the air was cooling off in Montreat quite a bit.  There was a little excitment around the office this afternoon, with the normal hustle and bustle of a newspaper.  </p>

<p>I love to sit at night and delve into the work of the other shooters at the paper.  Each shooter here has a natural given talent for some aspect of photography be it lighting, spot news, features, sports and everything else.  The colors, expressions, “decisive moments” leave me in awe on a daily/weekly basis.  Sometimes I just want to know how they got the shot.  </p>

<p>Here’s a quite moment from the fair the other day.  There was a little old lady at the Oval Offfice display where you can have your picture taken and she was waiting for her son to fetch her wheelchair while I stood in front of her.  Almost on cue, she raised her hand in almost magical state as if she could read my mind and I snapped two shots off of her.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/fair1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/fair1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

‘neath The grey sky<br />
And I’m wonderin’<br />

Must I lay low<br />
In a room full of strangers?<br />
Well, I’m thinking<br />
Thinking makes the danger<br />
My emotions they get all tangled up and<br />
My heart has just turned ‘round  </p>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could express what I’m feeling better than what usually comes out of my mouth.  Words are a lot harder than photos.  The photos come naturally, when you least expect them, but most of the time, words are hard to find.  It’s hard explainging to someone your feelings, when you know good and well they don’t care are want to listen.  </p>

<p>Listening to people is really hard.  It’s easy to hear people, but it’s hard to listen to them.  I’ve wondered before if most people listen, or if they just hear?  </p>

<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/fair3.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/fair3.jpg" alt="" /></a>It feels good to start posting again.  It’s been something that I’ve been neglecting to do for a number of reasons.  One, a steady internet connection and two, I haven’t been out taking many photos.  It use to be easy to photograph people, now since I don’t really have a purpose to be at an event, it makes it tougher.  There are always a lot more questions about why I’m photographing something/someone, I guess it’s something that you learn to overcome.  I can’t say that I’m on assignment, but I’m an employee of the paper, which usually leads to more questions, which I suppose is better than the command statement “Take my picture!”  that usually works.  </p>

<p>I went to the fair today for the first time, it was interesting.  I’ll go back tomorrow afternoon if the sun is out.  I was ran off by some irrate worker while trying to photograph a booth.  I had a good shot set up and the guy just walks in front of me telling me that I’ll have to go to customer service if I want to continue to take pictures.  Why is this my luck?  What did I do to deserve his harassment?  And how did he know that I haven’t been there already?  This sucks…. Other than that, the fair was cool, a little weird, but kind of cool.  I’ll be sure to post some more photos on here later.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>I’ve been in Columbia for two months now, and I’ve been trying to go out and shoot on my own.  The hard part is, it use to be so easy to approach people to photograph them when I was working as a photojournalist for a newspaper, I had a reason.  But now, it’s harder to approach people as an ordinary photojournalist, just an average joe with a camera.  It seems that there are more questions raised now, “what are you doing here?” “why?” “who are you photographing” and of course as always “take my picture!!”  A friend of mine and I are thinking about starting http://www.heytakemypicture.com for all those moments :)  </p>

<p>So I decided to that this weekend was a great weekend to go out and photograph events.  My first event was the Cop doughnut eating contest, but it didn’t start until one o’clock, so I headed for the First Lady’s Walk For Life.  Little did I know that it would turn out to be important that I went to this event.  After that, I headed back to the set of the new Kevin Bacon movie “Death Sentence” and photographed some action there with Brett, after that it was off to work.  The photo that I post today is my favorite photo from today, I like how the legs on the right hand side frame in the women in the back of the picture, I thought it was nice and had more of my personal vision in it. To make a long story short, a different shot that I took ended up running as the Metro Centerpiece.  I know that this might not be big news, but I would like to see the look on five people’s faces as they see my photograph monday morning at their office.  </p>

<p>Here’s the link to the article that ran in today’s paper http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/15705301.htm with the photo that did run in the paper.  It’s not my greatest, but it is a straight-forward documentay image, and that’s about it.  Until next time, enjoy! <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/walk.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/walk.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>This is a great weekend to be in Columbia.  There are many events going on around town, the air is crisp, the light is beautiful, and the people are nice.  Maybe it’s because fall is here and halloween is around the corner, I’m not sure what it is, but I am enjoying it, I was even able to sleep with my bedroom windows open last night.  </p>

<p>I woke up this morning ready to go to two events today, a cop doughnut eating contest and a walk for life.  I was renewed with the idea of taking photos for the second time in three months.  The first event that I wanted to go to was at Finlay park, I had just seen it the other day, but where?  After driving around for 20 minutes on the wrong side of town, I called Maxie and found out that it was behind the post office, of course!! That’s where I saw it the other day, at the post office.  But why would they be having a walk for life on Friday morning when most people are at work? Actually, why are either one of these events happening on Friday, when most people are at work?  I didn’t know, and I didn’t care, because I was going to take some great photos, even if I was a little late from oversleeping.  </p>

<p>Once I arrived at these events, I realized when I didn’t see anyone that it must be tomorrow when these things are going on.  One quick look at today’s newspaper and sure enough, in my frenzy to photograph something, I didn’t realize the dates were for Saturday, can you blame me though, I don’t even wear a watch!  </p>

<p>So this afternoon proved to be better as I headed to the Carolina BBQ Cup at the farmers Market.  The fragence of fresh muskadines danced through the air with hickory smoke from the cue. Here is one photo from today, Enjoy<img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/IMG_3914.jpg" alt="![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/IMG_3914.jpg)" /></p>

Anyway, a freelancer from the paper and I went to Lugoff-Elgin High School to shoot some friday night football.  This is one of my better shots, and there’ll be more to come, but this one is of the sousaphone player warming up.

I walked and walked and when I found found this guy, I was a little upset because I thought it was a group, and it turned out to be only him.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I hung out with him for an hour while he practiced for the highland games next weekend.  I wish that I could have recorded some nat sound of this guy playing and him talking abou what it takes to play the bagpipes, the different types of reeds he uses and how your lips go numb after playing for a long time.  He told me about how he would go o the highland games next weekend and he would play the bagpipes and represent his family there, he was amazing.  </p>

<p>So this is my contribution for the day.  Enjoy.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/scotland.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/scotland.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

They’ve been out of their home since Wednesday afternoon of last week. I talked to them for a while as they walked around and surveyed the damage. “We were lucky, we were so afraid that the fire would jump the road and that our house would burn down. I’m just glad to be back, It’s good to sleep in my own bed again.” Amanda said. “We didn’t imagine that anything like this would happen here.”<br />

Some of the townspeople I talked to today were put off by all the attenion they’ve been getting lately, but for others, it’s back to their everyday normal life.  One of the ladies I talked to felt like she had been forced from her home.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>You know, it seems like this blog was so much eaiser to update when I had a full time job and something to post.  Right now, I’m just seeking full time work at another newspaper.  Yes I understand that I could go out and get any other job, but that’s not what I want to do.  That’s how it starts.  You start thinking about bills, insurance and everything else under the sun, so you tell yourself that “you’ll just get a job to cover the bills”  Then you keep working to maintain the lifestyle that you created the first time around and then before you know it, it’s been one full year and you haven’t shot a single assignment.  </p>

<p>So this is my plea, I need help.  I need help from anyone who can give me any advice.  I need a full time job as a news photographer, I don’t want to waist my god given gift, it would be a shame.  I have no idea how or who to network with.  Things are very confusing right now.  I need work, but when you read the chatter on the internet, you start to ask yourself if you’re really screwing yourself and every other photographer over by not keeping your copyright?  I wish that I could go into detail about some of the contracts that I’ve signed before, but I’m afraid of doing so, it might hurt my ability to continue shooting.  Most newspapers want 100% of your copyright and are willing to pay next to nothing.  And if I don’t take it, someone else will, because they want to make a name for themselves.  They don’t take much into consideration and nor do we, it’s bad right now for my industry.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/IMG_0156.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/IMG_0156.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>I have considered grad school, but from what I understand, you have to have a thesis?  What would I say? What is my position on topics in the world?  My problem, I don’t have a really strong passion about many things, only a few.  For example, how is it possible that 62 million people can vote for Amercian Idol, but we can never get those kind of numbers to elect a president?  Or Brad and Angelia are going to sell exclusive photos of their baby to Getty Images and procceds go to charity.  Who cares about their baby?  We are the richest nation in the world, but yet are one of the most wasteful and we take everyday things for granted.  It makes me sick, I know, I too am the same way.  </p>

<p>I’m starting to think that there’s no justice left in the world.  Who will stand up for the people with no voice?  Is it that hard to give 30 dollars a month to a family who really needs it?  I can understand being the CEO of a big company, I’m sure it’s stressful, but 626 million dollars for a yearly salary?  I’m sure that doesn’t include “gifts” either.  Where’s the justice in keeping someone who is a half asser and fire those who care?  Should we just not care anymore?  No and that’s the problem, all we care about is us and keeping us happy.  Why not help someone else?  just one small favor, it could be anything, but just show someone that they matter to you, that is if you’re not to busy and you can pencil me in on your blackberry.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>So, as you may or may not know, I am still looking for a fulltime job at another newspaper.  I have been working as a freelancer, and it helps pay the bills, but, I miss my old job.  Where I was, not such, but I do miss what I was doing.  As I went to the lily festval at Landsford Canal State Park, I thought about what I would say to the people I use to work for if I had the chance to run into on the streets.  Would I just play the “guilty by assocation” card, or would I be cordial?  Well I’ll be dog-gone if I didn’t run into the person that fired me today.  It took a lot not to say anything, just a smile and wave, that’s all that I could muster.  </p>

<p>Yesterday was Joe’s wedding.  He was my rommate from my freshman year at Mars Hill, and it seems like only yesterday we were hanging watching snow blow into the window during the winter.  It’s funny how people grow up and grow apart and yet something like a wedding can bring them all back together like nothing has changed, but somehow it’s different.  His wedding was amazing, it was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest and a reception at the Ciero Tise House off of 4th street.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/joewedding1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/joewedding1.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>I would say that about 20 of his closet fraternity brothers were there and I thought that was great.  As usual, you always have a “core” group that will leave to pursue their own escapades.  But that’s ok, it’s not the first, and it won’t be the last.  I’m happy for Joe, it seems like he and Jennifer will have a great life ahead of them.  A lot of people asked me about my relationship with Christy.  My answer?  “We’ll see”  It seems like when you have things figured out, life throws you a curve ball, just to make sure that you’re not asleep at the plate.  </p>

<p>It’s time for me to do something, a interview a review or anyhting to keep my spirits up.  If I could do anything right now, I would love to do some international tavel and go to Haiti or an area that I could stand to make a difference.  But then I started thinking about it, if everyone has been there, how can I make a difference?  What could I say, what could I photograph that hasn’t been done one million times by someone else?  And that’s when it hit me, my heart is in community journalism and that’s where I belong, and that’s where I want to be.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/joewedding2.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/joewedding2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>As a Christian I believe in destiny.  The axe effect is what happened last week.  After almost two full years, I was fired on Thursday morning from the paper.  The reason being?  Good question.  It seems that my actions at the paper were viewed as “insubordinate” and my services were no longer need.  And, it hurt, and I cried.  I had put so much hard work and effort into honestly wanting to change the paper and change the way that people see things, that now, it seems so worthless, like I was never really needed.  </p>

<p>But the good thing about destiny is that everything happens for a reason.  We, must understand why it happens, because all we can truly control are our reactions.  People have asked me a lot of questions about the events that transpired at the paper, but to remain professional, I try not to answer them in bad light.  </p>

<p>I liked my job, I loved being able to explore the town and surrounding areas of lancaster, and I got paid to do it.  But in the end, it looks like that wasn’t good enough for some.  So what did I do when I got fired?  What anyone else would do, I headed straight for our competiting papers, the Rock Hill Herald and Fort Mill Times, both owned by McClatchy.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/IMG_2916.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/IMG_2916.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Sometimes, we lose sight of what’s important to us.  It could be as simple as spending time with a loved one, holding their hand, or it could be a long walk down a trail, or relaxing in a hammock by the beach or under a shade tree, but in the 21st century, we have become so involved, we never know when to “turn off” or unplug.  Being fired really opened my eyes.  I realized that there is a world outside of me, and it’s so much bigger than I will ever be, I should just go out and explore it.  Filing for unemployement really woke me up also.  For once in my life, I felt like I was at the bottom of the barrel with nowhere else to go.  To them, you aren’t Chip Oglesby, ace photographer, you’re just someone else in line, and I guess that’s what I needed,  good kick in the pants!  </p>

<p>So to everyone out there, I will be ok, I will make it, because I believe that God has a plan for me, and for everyone else.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/eastertrish.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/eastertrish.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Have a great day.  </p>

<p>And, now that I’m not shooting fulltime, I might not post as much, but I will be back!</p>

Gregg Rec center where <a href="http://www.toddbennettphotography.com/">Todd Bennett</a> taught us how to properly light a high school gym using Nikon SB 800’s, something with our paper actually has.  He also showed us how how to light them using <a href="http://www.pocketwizard.com/">Pocket Wizards</a>. One of the most interesting discussions was led by Spokesman-Reivew’s Colin Mulvany.  Colin is Spokesman’s Video Journalist working on different multimedia stories daily.  <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/ssc.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/ssc.jpg" alt="" /></a>He discussed the future of photojournalism, which is going to be multimedia on the internet.  His videos provides insight that regular vj’s at TV stations don’t usually give viewers.  One of the most moving multimedia pieces I’ve seen came from the mountain workshops dvd that we watched in the morning.  You can see this Multimedia piece here.  </p>

<p>Speakers also included <a href="http://www.amivitale.com/">Ami Vitale</a> and <a href="http://www.vincentlaforet.com/">Vincent Laforet</a>.  They both gave a lot of insight about their careers as photojournalist and gave a lot of young shooters advice.  <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/laforet.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/laforet.jpg" alt="" /></a>Saturday evening was a portfolio critique which I skipped supper for.  I was there from 8:00pm to 3:00am waiting to get my portfolio critiqued.  I got some good reviews, and a lot of people liked the colors in my photos.  One thing that I would like to be able to include in the future is some multimedia pieces.  One of the biggest problems that I saw was younger pj’s were including two or three of the exact same photos which if they cut out, could cut their portfolios in half.  Other than that, I was truly inspired by the amount of great work there, and being around all these people gave me new inspiration for my work and renergized me.  </p>

<p>Until next time…</p>

So what do you do about it?<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/lottery.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/lottery.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>If you live in N.C. starting tomorrow you can buy your own tickets in your own state.  A lot of businesses around the border of N.C./S.C. don’t feel like it will have a large impact on them.  “There are people who live in Charlotte and work here, and the other way around, so it will equal out”  That seems to be the opinion of most.  The odds of winning are 1 in 146 million.  So think about it before you spend your hard earned money.</p>

<p>Every year, hundreds of race fans and drivers gather at the Lancaster Raceway, known as the dirt track.  This track sends many race fans back to days of yester year, when red dirt, not asphalt, good old know how, not scientific formulas ruled the track.  </p>

<p>For many, it was the honor of winning a race that meant more than just a cash prize.  There’s a quote on the winners circle that says “If you can finish in the top five here, you can win at any track in the country.”  </p>

<p>Many hours are put into preparing for one race that a driver might not win.  Some do not make it past the qualifing heat because of a blown engine or other mishap, but that will only fuel their return for next week’s race.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/racea.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/racea.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>To each of the drivers it means something different.  Ages range from 15 to 50, but when the green flag drops the only thing that matters is how you push the clutch and drive your car around each turn and for once, they are all equal, no matter what age.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>As I sit at work, it’s close to 1:15 am, all I hear is the hum of computer fans, clicking of keys on the keyboard and the TV cover the local news.  Thoughts rush through my heads like floodwaters through gates.  Thoughts of love, life, happiness, saddness, hope, despair and baseball.<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/park.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/park.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
I thought that I would sit down and write a very personal blog about all of these thoughts, but instead, all these ideas are swirling around in my head no stop.  Ideas about everything, from how to save money to fix problems to telling someone that you still love them.  </p>

<p>Everytime I get ready to type, all of these thoughts and ideas just jam together, like a hodge podge of food on a plate, all being mixed together by a young child who does not want to eat.  </p>

<p>The cause of a lot of pleasure and pain in my life comes from my work.  I love it the majority of the time, but I’ve also learned to loathe my profession.  For the first time that I can remember, I actually felt emotionally involved in an assignment.    </p>

<p>Not that I had anything to gain or loose, but most of the time, I am just there as an observer, a visual recorder.  This lady stood in front of an audience of about 100 + people and talked about the loosing her son in a drunk driving accident. And I actually listened.  </p>

<p>A lot of times, when you go to an assignment, there a tendency to say “hey, I’m not a part of this” and you don’t become emotionally involved and other times, it’s hard to  ignore.  This wednesday, as this subject stood in front of the audience, grieving, you could physically hear her pain as she described her final days with her son.  It was hard to ignore, even harder to say “hey, this will never happen to me”    </p>

<p>Her body language, her tears, her trembling voice, it was all too much for me. To hear her say that she still hears her son’s voice everyday, to hear her talk about driving past his grave everyday, it was amazing that she was able to talk about it, it must be hard.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/sset.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/sset.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>It reminded me of everytime I drank, not that I drove or rode with a drunk driver, but all of the times it could have happened, and remembering that I wasn’t even thinking about it sometimes.  God I’m stupid.</p>

Today was harder to shoot.  I found out later on tonight that they hold slack events during the day, which is a way for all 120 competitors to compete in the rodeo, but they save the best for the night shows.  <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/rodeo.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/rodeo.jpg" alt="" /></a>Which is one thing that I don’t understand, why have this event at night?  It’s hard as heck to shoot, the flash startles ever horse there, so let’s have it during the day!  Thank God for feature hunting.  </p>

<p>This high school rodeo isn’t all about skoal and yee-haw’s! all night long, these group of kids are more like a family than anything else.  During the week, they’re just like normal high school students but on the weekend, they travel across the state to different rodeos that are sometimes two days long.  It’s fun and most of them enjoy, from what they told me.  There are also a lot of emotions involved in the rodeo, the kids take their work very seriously, some too seriously, but that is to be expected at a young age.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/rodeo2.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/rodeo2.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
Before I left, I saw a group of cowboys and girls gathered together doing a devotional and scripture reading.  The guy in charge was talking about how one of the certain things in life is death, which got me thinking about it.  Not dying, but occupying my life until that unpleasant moment happens.  One thing that I think most people do is take things for granted until they’ve lost it, only then to realize that they needed it more than they could ever realize.  I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the difference between self-preservation and self-centernedness.  I admit, often, I get these two confused.  I want to help others, and i try real hard, but neglect own self, then when I help myself, I feel self-centered.  weird right?  I thought so.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>When it comes to photography, nothing is more special than having your photos published in a big name outlet, New York Times, National Geographic and Sports Illustrated.  I so far have only been in Sports Illustrated.  While this is a goal of most people, there are also more important concerns for photojournalist.  </p>

<p>Community Journalism. Those two words are bittersweet to most journalists in both written and photographic mediums.  A lot of people may not admit it, but when it gets down to the nitty-gritty, all you have is family, and sometimes your community family.  </p>

<p>Iraq, Jakarta, South Africa, New Orleans, they are all important places and many photographers are ready to rush there in a moments notice, but who will be the voice of your hometown? Does a photographer go to these places because a photo they take will make a difference, or do they go to pad their portfolio and win contest?  If the answer is the latter, I suggest that you not go more people will come behind for the same reasons, some with honest intentions to make a difference.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/militaryball.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/militaryball.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Community Journalism comes from the heart.  It’s not something that you learn in class, it’s not something that you do within the confines of your cubicle; it’s something that you must actively participate in.  Yes, it may not change the world, but it will change the life of someone, and that someone may be the person who needs it the most.  The person who will be most affected by it will be you.  </p>

<p>A lot of International work takes deep pockets, extended amounts of time and can strain resources to no extent, but have you ever thought about the stories that need to be told in your own community?  Right now, there could be someone dying from cancer, someone celebrating the birth of a child, or rejoicing that a loved one is home, and it is a challenge, it’s always a challenge, but it’s worth it.  </p>

<p>Instead of going to a land where you don’t speak the language or you my die from your actions, why not play it safe and explore your own surroundings. Go outside or to a park, and sit on the ground.  Shut your eyes and listen. Don’t just hear a sound but visualize it, try to see the sound, recreate the scene in your mind, with your eyes shut.  Think about what direction it came from, what was it? Was it human or something else? Then open your eyes and go photograph that subject. That’s how you learn to “see” and that’s only one way, and there are so many more!</p>

<p>A lot of people came up and congratuled me on my sweep on the Photo Essay Series, they all said “savor it now, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rarely happens.” The thing that upsets me the most is the judges comments on the 1st place personality photo “Great use of alternate light to take advantage of the fading evening sky.  Makes for a more dramatic pose.”  </p>

<p>First off, what the heck?  Thanks for the comments, but FYI, I got up at 5:30am to take this stinking photo!  I’m glad it was awarded first, but come on!  The suggestion of shooting it at night was made, but I said that if we really wanted it to be a “dawn of a new season” then we need to shoot it at dawn, not at dusk!  The dusk of a new season?  That doesn’t sound right.</p>

They will say “yeah, that’s exactly how I saw it, but why didn’t my photos turn out the same way?”  It’s not that I have a magic trick or solution that I can’t share, it’s just that I have the experience of seeing what most don’t.

<p>One of the exciting things about living near asheville is being able to go and explore the city.  There are a lot of interesting people there, but did you know that you have to pay to park almost everywhere?  I’m use to that in Charlotte, but I drove for nearly 20 minutes without finding a free parking spot!  I have always loved Tunnel Road, it’s like the equivelant of Cherry Road in Rock Hill, if you can’t find it there, you may not need it.  If it’s not there, look on Merrimon, it will be there.  One of the cool things to do as a freshman is to drive through the Tunnel and honk your horn, or something that’s just about as juvenile, but I do not reccomend trying to drive and photograph it at the same time, unless you are me, which you aren’t.</p>

<p>Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, grant them rest.  </p>

<p>Christy was in a concert this past Tuesday night at the <a href="http://www.koger.sc.edu/">Kroger Center</a> in Columbia at <a href="http://www.sc.edu/">USC</a>. Let me just say, it was amazing!  I love Mozart and when I was a junior at Mars Hill, I discovered his Requiem.  Did you know that at <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tan/Mozartreq/main.html">age five Mozart started composing minuets</a>? Do you know what I was doing at five?  Getting my finger stuck in the bumper of my dad’s Jeep!<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/mozart.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/mozart.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
Mozart could easily be one of the greatest composers of the millennium.  I wonder how he would feel about current music trends?  We he be a rapper or a rock-n-roll type person?  He would probably mash both of them together!  I also wonder how well he would adapt to using a computer to compose music?  Christy showed me how to do it one day in her music class; it was pretty interesting composing your own score on a computer.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the concert was amazing.  Now, me being nearly tone deaf, I couldn’t tell, but apparently, they all sucked, and were really bad, but it was music to my ears!  </p>

<p>I’m heading up to Montreat tonight, to see my niece, I can’t wait, I’m very excited.  Have a great weekend.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>Buford played Calhoun County at Fairfield Central High School wednesday evening, and lost 70-40.  They made a strong comeback in the second half within 10 points, but couldn’t pull off the win.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/bhsbasketball.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/bhsbasketball.jpg" alt="" /></a> I remember what it’s like to be in high school, and loose a game that is really important to you.  </p>

<p>i was standing and watching Joel West who was being comforted by his mom Laura, when I was instally transformed back to my senior year at Indian Land.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/west.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/west.jpg" alt="" /></a>We played Mcbee for homecoming that year, the only game we had won the whole season, so far, and for me, it was bittersweet.  Knowing that it was a culmination of my high school football career quickly sent me to a depressive state following the win.    </p>

<p>Instead of celebrating with the rest of the team and being greeted by friends and family, I ran of the field in a horrible emotional state.  I remember running past my mom who was standing near the end zone, arms open and just making my way to the locker room, crying the whole time.  </p>

<p>As I look back on it now, I realize that probably wasn’t the best thing to do, but at the time, it was too much for me to handle.  When you’re in high school, you don’t realize that life will continue, and like most people’s experience it will be fine.  You get wrapped up in the feeling that this will never happen again and you try to savor every minute of it.    </p>

<p>There are more emotions in high school sports then just about any other level you will experience.  For some, it’s only the start of their career, but for most, it will be the end and they will play their hearts out, sweat blood, break bones, and enjoy every minute of it.  </p>

<p>Joel took me back to a time when playing sports meant something, not the glitz and glamour of pro athletes and not the over zealous individuals of college sports.  It was about the love of the game, the teamwork and dedication of many individuals that would carry their team further than any other Buford high school basketball team.  </p>

<p>I would like to see more athletes like West participate in high school sports and as long as they continue to play, the love of the game will continue.</p>

Charleston, Columbia and Asheville, not bad for three weekends. Yesterday was rough, I’m glad I posted something in the morning because I couldn’t do it last night, too tired. I worked 13 hours and 1 hour for lunch, which suprisingly, is always about business, so I should be getting paid to have lunch, don’t see that happening anytime soon though.  </p>

<p>I noticed something new on the way to work this morning, someone tagged the back of the old Winn-Dixie, we’ve run some of the “gang related” stuff in the paper, and I was wondering, why doesn’t someone just set up shop in the bushes to catch the people doing this? It had to happen between 10:30pm and 10:00am, which I know, 12 hours is a long time, but, still.  </p>

<p>Anyway, today’s picture is from yesterday’s soccer game. I was there for a total of 15 minutes, and had to walk away with something good. This is the same girl that I photographed earlier this year, and ended up in Sports Illustrated.

<p>We took a tour of the state house grounds and took photos along the way, in the rain, it was nice for a change, to be able to photograph something without the pressures of deadlines.

This is part of an Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) debutante program that young black women from the county are in. Tonight was hard for most of them, who would be showcasing their talent in front of a live studio audience.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/nerves.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/nerves.jpg" alt="" /></a>  I usually like to get to these types of events early so that I can hangout and get to know the people that I’llbe photographing later on.

I just click this button right here, and this moment is frozen in time forever!  Shortly there after, they realize that I’m talking about taking a photograph, not actually freezing time, lol.  </p>

I try to see how fast I can photograph someone after they’ve asked me to take their picture, and how off guard they were.  That act is usually always followed by “hey, i wasn’t ready” which I always quickly reply “well neither was I when you asked me!”  Sometimes, I’ll take another one.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/notready.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/notready.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Seriously though, one day, I will publish a book called “Take my picture” and include all of these photos of people who have made this request.  Another thing that got me thinking about all of this is when Gov. Mark Sanford was in town on Thursday night.  I was there and i took his picture.  This one could be similar to the thinking man statue if i would have worked it more, but I was busting my butt, since all the republicans in the room were talking about the <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-liberalmedia.htm">“liberal media”</a>.  What the heck is that?  Anyway, I was getting ready to leave and this guy was like, Chip, do you mind taking a picture of me and the governor?  I did wihout thinking much about it.  Then I realized, no one ever ask if I want my picture taken with anyone, I even have my own camera!  But, I think ethically, that would be wrong.  I guess I have to enjoy knowing that I was there and that I got to photograph this important person, and I have the proof, and hope to god that someone else with a camera will take a picture of me, like I do of them!  </p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>“If you don’t know where you’ve come from, you’ll never know where you’re going.”  I’m not sure who said it, but they were smart.  Why is it that I can never think of something that clever that everyone will be saying for the rest of there life?  Maybe one day, but not today.  </p>

<p>Today was my day off, well the better part of today.  I worked a whopping total of 3.5 hours.  Laugh all you want, but considering the past 4 days have all been an average of 10.5 hours apiece, I don’t even consider 3.5 hours anything.  Today was a day of rest and relaxation.  I surfed the blogger site, reading random blogs, and apperently, there are a lot of people with Chinese blogs, followed by love blogs and tying in at thrid, political blogs and poetry blogs.  People have a lot to say, but are they really saying anything?  </p>

<p>I know for a fact that three people read this blog.  The main one, myself, and the others are two friends of mine.  How do I know? they are the only two people who have left me comments.  Thank you, you two people, you make this blog worth it.  Actually, I don’t care if anyone reads this blog or not, this blog is strictly for me.  It is being used as more of a photo diary, than anything else, so one day, when I look back, I’ll know where I came from.  </p>

<p>Speaking of which, here’s one of my favorite photos, based purely on the subject matter, my father.  My parents have been divorced since 1990, which is a long time, but I still love them both dearly.  I took this picture my junior year, when I lived in Myers with my fraternity brother dan on the second floor, down at the end.  Why is that special? Because we had the biggest room in Myers, minus the Ra’s room.  But I photograph my dad as much as possible.  Not because he is famous, but because there are a lot of memories I have of him, and a lot that I’d rather forget, so for me, it’s like documenting history, for my family.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/dad.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/dad.jpg" alt="" /></a>  </p>

<p>Later on in college, once I worked for the Fort Mill Times, I discovered that other than just liking girls, I found that I saw the inner beauty in all girls, not just the most beautiful ones.  The girl that I fell in love with, Christy, my girlfriend, taught me this.  It’s about more than just looks, sex appeal, or money, it goes deeper than that, and she taught me how to find that in myself.  </p>

<p>I always loved taking portraits of people.  I’ve said it before, but the most revealing feature about people: Eyes.  There is a wealth of knowledge and insight in people’s eyes, you just have to look.  You can see such a range of emotions and so much more by looking people in the eyes.  </p>

<p>Two of the people that I first photographed in college was Megan and Laura, both truly unique and awesome girls.  Laura, a very tall and slender Audrey Hepburn look a like, a Megan, a bubbly, outgoing girl who just has the all american cuteness, let me photograph them, I’ll never know why.  But I had the best time doing it, almost as much fun as doing documentary work at the time.  If you ever want to learn about people, ask them to let you photograph them, you’ll learn a lot, trust me. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/laura.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/laura.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />

<p>Times have changed, and some of my interst has changed in what I enjoy photographing, but documenting and photographing people will always be at the center of my heart.  The way that we do this will change, naturally, but the love it it will always be the same.  </p>

<p>like the saying goes “remembering where you came from, will help you with where you’re going.”  Good night and God Bless.</p>

      "excerpt"		: "<p>Someone asked me today, what do you do for a living?  </p>

<p>After a brief pause, I told them that I was a photographer, er, photojournalist. “so you just take pictures?, yeah, pretty much” I answered, and I didn’t think much more about it until later.  </p>

<p>To me, my job is so much more than just taking pictures.  There’s a higher calling, and that is to record history, everday in Lanaster County.  Now, I might not have been to Iraq yet, but it’s still just as important.  One day, someone will look back at my photos as a visual recording as to what happened, and to me, that’s the best feeling ever.  </p>

<p>I may never will a Pulitzer at The Lancaster News, but, one day, these pictures will matter to someone, and that makes me really happy.  </p>

<p>The second, and harder part of my job, is teaching people how to “see.”  Before I became a photograher, and had my “awaking” as I called it, I couldn’t “see.”  Someone told me “How well you see, has nothing to do with how well you see.”  Talk about deep…  </p>

<p>It finally dawned on me one day that I wasn’t “seeing”, and I had to change.  I can’t tell you exactly what or how it happened, but it was about a year after I started working here that I started seeing things differently.  It doesn’t make me, you or anyone else a freak, it just means that we see things in ways that other people can’t.  And that’s another part of my job.  </p>

<p>People always ask me, how did you take that photo, but you know, people never ask me why.  Why is that?  Wouldn’t you be more concerned with why someone is doing this a certain way, instead of how they did it?  I understand the argument behind, the how question, but I use to ask that all the time, but the more important question is WHY?  </p>

<p>This is applicable in any situation, not just photography.  The people who know “how” to do a task will always have a job, the people who know “why” will always be their boss, pretty smart eh?  </p>

<p>So, if you want to get ahead, know “how” to do something, but also, know “why” you’re doing it.  More change happens when you ask why, as opposed to when you ask “how”,  Think about it.  </p>

<p>Here’s a photo that i took today at track practice.  I’ll tell you how I took it, but what I want you to think about is why I took the photo this way.  Post a comment, and let me know your answers.  Let’s see how smart you are world!!<img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/track.jpg" alt="![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/track.jpg)" /></p>

<p>I was planning on going out and taking photos today, but it was crappy outside.  Who thought it would be crappy in Charleston?  But on the good side, I did get a Canon umbrella, and a nice one at that.  I’ve always wanted an umbrealla, and now I have one.  I almost lost it this afternoon.  The wind was blowing really bad and I was walking through the parking lot with it, trying to be cool, and then all of the sudden, this gust of wind blew it out of my hands, and I’m chasing it around the lot of the post and courier, I guess it was a sight to see.  </p>

<p>Here’s today’s photo, it’s of me dan and becca at Wet Willie’s having a few drinks, catching up on old times.  good stuff.  I wish Christy were here, that would be awesome, the four of us, together again.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/danbecca.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/danbecca.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
