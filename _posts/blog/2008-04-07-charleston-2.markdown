I woke up this morning and it was really nice outside.  Instead of being responsible and doing chores and laundry, I packed a towel and my camera and set out for Sullivan's Island.  ![](http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nAuOZ7_4I/AAAAAAAAAQs/Zoj_tONgQD0/s400/IMG_9599.JPG)Somewhere between Columbia and Charleston, near Holly Hill, the lines on the melting asphalt turn from dotted lines into stretchy lines of taffy that pass by my window as the sun warms my face through the sunroof of my car.  
  
One of the reasons for the trip was to test my car to see how it was holding up.  It's a '95 and is pushing over 200,400 miles on it (after todays trip).  As soon as I was about to drift off while Bob Marley mellows me out, I see the first glimmer of of the low-country, a palm tree.  Soon, I see rows and rows of palm trees as I draw closer to Charleston.  After crossing the Ravenel bridge, I make a few turns and arrive at my destination, Sullivan's Island.[![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nDxeZ7_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/e1-8z9bP6Xk/s400/IMG_9596.JPG)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nDxeZ7_5I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/e1-8z9bP6Xk/s1600-h/IMG_9596.JPG)  
  
There are two main reasons why I go to SI.  The first is being, it's so much less crowded than Isle of Palms.  You can walk and walk and not see the tops of neon color house sticking out over the dunes like small peeps (candy) in a pile of sugar. The second reason is Poe's Tavern.  They have the best Mahi Tacos and Yellowfin Tuna tacos.  Either one and a corona will leave you in a daze for the rest of the afternoon.  
  
After keeping my feet in the warm sand and getting a nice tan on my face, I headed to Poe's for some dinner and then went to IOP to watch the sun set.[![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nFEuZ7_6I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Sb2mr54dcCU/s400/IMG_9607.JPG)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nFEuZ7_6I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Sb2mr54dcCU/s1600-h/IMG_9607.JPG)  There are so many times when I've talked about doing things and never followed through, but after spending all day yesterday thinking about consumerism, I decided to put my thoughts into action.  God made all of this beautiful land for us to enjoy and give him praise for allowing us to take shelter here, shouldn't we get out and enjoy it?[![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nGXeZ7_7I/AAAAAAAAARE/4EYBAKM-hRY/s400/IMG_9595.JPG)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R_nGXeZ7_7I/AAAAAAAAARE/4EYBAKM-hRY/s1600-h/IMG_9595.JPG)The drive back seemed to be so much quicker than the drive down and I've often wondered why? Am I ready to get back home?  Is it because it's night time?  Within no time, I had arrived safely at home without anyone knowing I was even gone.
