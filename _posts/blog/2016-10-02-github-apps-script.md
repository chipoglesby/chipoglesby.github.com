Recently we created a simple Google Form at work that allows marketing
coworkers to submit what we call "list requests". These requests help us write
SQL queries that will pull various information on customers for them to market to.

Currently we have a simple Apps Script that will email the appropriate people
which works great.

Part of what I'm leading is a process that brings a better discipline to our
team and workflow.

To help bring consistency and a repeatable process to this, I thought it would
be interesting to create a Google Apps Script that creates an issue in Github
that people can then work on using Github Flow.

The script that is attached below is really just a proof of concept, if you
wanted to flesh it out, you would have to add other features, like calling the
Google Sheets API or something else.

The best way to get started is by assigning yourself a
[Personal Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) and
authenticating using
[Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication).

Below is a sample script that will help you get started on your journey!

Replace the xxx values with your own.

Enjoy and happy scripting.
