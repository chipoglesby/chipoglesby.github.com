Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, dona eis requiem.  
  
Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, grant them rest.  
  
Christy was in a concert this past Tuesday night at the [Kroger Center](http://www.koger.sc.edu/) in Columbia at [USC](http://www.sc.edu/). Let me just say, it was amazing!  I love Mozart and when I was a junior at Mars Hill, I discovered his Requiem.  Did you know that at [age five Mozart started composing minuets](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tan/Mozartreq/main.html)? Do you know what I was doing at five?  Getting my finger stuck in the bumper of my dad’s Jeep!

Mozart could easily be one of the greatest composers of the millennium.  I wonder how he would feel about current music trends?  We he be a rapper or a rock-n-roll type person?  He would probably mash both of them together!  I also wonder how well he would adapt to using a computer to compose music?  Christy showed me how to do it one day in her music class; it was pretty interesting composing your own score on a computer.  
  
Anyway, the concert was amazing.  Now, me being nearly tone deaf, I couldn’t tell, but apparently, they all sucked, and were really bad, but it was music to my ears!  
  
I’m heading up to Montreat tonight, to see my niece, I can’t wait, I’m very excited.  Have a great weekend.
