So it's been almost two months that I've been working at the State paper and this is one of the first chances that I've had to go out and shoot a meaningful assignment.  I should't call it an assignment, it's more of a self-assignment and I hope to do more of them once I switch to the sunday-thursday schedule.  Anyway, a freelancer from the paper and I went to Lugoff-Elgin High School to shoot some friday night football.  This is one of my better shots, and there'll be more to come, but this one is of the sousaphone player warming up.  I like this shot for the composition and the layering as well as the over all "warm" feeling of the photo.
