Back from my mini Thanksgiving holiday and just now starting to process all of the photos.  I took too many and only had my powerbook battery to rely on since my AC adapter decided to poop out on me one night last week.  I figured I would start posting the photos with something a little different.  This is from the pier down in the village of St. Simons, Enjoy![![](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/1441/2633/400/313241/IMG_5947.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/413671/IMG_5947.jpg)
