2016 was a great year for me to read books. It started when I created an account
on [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) to keep track of the books that
I've read in the past, mainly the ones I could remember reading.

I set a goal of reading 52 books this year and as of today, I passed that
goal with 55 books.

Here are my top five favorite books from 2016:

1. Steiner, Christopher. [_Automate This_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542772-automate-this)
2. Shetterly, Margot Lee. [_Hidden Figures_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29555236-hidden-figures)
3. O'Neil, Cathy. [_Weapons of Math Destruction_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28509312-weapons-of-math-destruction)
4. Hodges, Andrew. [_Alan Turing: The Enigma_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22501993-alan-turing)
5. Poundstone, William. [_Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1155424.Fortune_s_Formula)

The majority of books I read are non-fiction, so I usually won't have anything
that is a best seller on my list.
