I spent most of the day searching through the campus of Montreat North Carolina while Scotland the Brave echoed through the hills and valleys.  I walked and walked and when I found found this guy, I was a little upset because I thought it was a group, and it turned out to be only him.  
  
Anyway, I hung out with him for an hour while he practiced for the highland games next weekend.  I wish that I could have recorded some nat sound of this guy playing and him talking abou what it takes to play the bagpipes, the different types of reeds he uses and how your lips go numb after playing for a long time.  He told me about how he would go o the highland games next weekend and he would play the bagpipes and represent his family there, he was amazing.  
  
So this is my contribution for the day.  Enjoy.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/scotland.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/scotland.jpg)
