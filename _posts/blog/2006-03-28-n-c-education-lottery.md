I think that is possible to be addicted to gambling or addicted to lottery tickets, but  some people think there's nothing wrong with it.  You can argue both sides, "It tears a family apart" "It put my kid through college" but either way, it's still being abused.  So what do you do about it?[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/lottery.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/lottery.jpg)  
  
If you live in N.C. starting tomorrow you can buy your own tickets in your own state.  A lot of businesses around the border of N.C./S.C. don't feel like it will have a large impact on them.  "There are people who live in Charlotte and work here, and the other way around, so it will equal out"  That seems to be the opinion of most.  The odds of winning are 1 in 146 million.  So think about it before you spend your hard earned money.
