I wanted to make a post about something else that's been on my mind lately, but since I can't access those photos right now, I wanted to post this photo instead.  It was from yesterday's baseball game.  I wish that If I could go back, I would find someone in the same exact pose, but only with water coming out of the hose and reflected on the wall.  Enjoy!
