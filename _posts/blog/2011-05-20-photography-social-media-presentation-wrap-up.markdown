In my presentation last night to [Social Media Club Columbia](http://www.smccolumbia.com), I discussed how bloggers can legally choose images for their sites. We also discussed the best options for hosting content, ie: self hosting, using a Content Delivery Network, Amazon's S3 buckets or a third party service such as flickr.

We also discussed how you can embed photos from sights such as flickr or picasa. We also dicussed how a Photographer or content creator can protect themselves by embedding IPTC and EXIF data into their photos and use the [tineye.](http://www.tineye.com/)

There are also people who don't want to copyright their images, instead they want to freely share their work with the world and there's a copyright (copyleft) for them as well at [creativecommons.org](http://www.creativecommons.org).

Creative Commons allows people to freely license their work any purpose that they would like. As you can see, today's post is licensed with a CC license that allows remixing and requires a share a like.

Wordpress has a plug in for blog posts if you would like to use this service. It's called wp-license reloaded, it's easy to install and customize.

Here&#039;s another Photo of the shuttle from my plane.  on Twitpic](http://twitpic.com/4yg6hs)
We also discussed what happens when someone like [Stefanie Gordon](http://www.twitter.com/stefmara) takes a photo, the one above, and all the sudden it spreads across the internet like wildfire. If someone uses her photo without permission, what's her recourse? Does she deserve to be compensated because she's not a professional photographer?  Did she happen to be in the right place at the right time?

Columbia, SC based photojournalist [Brett Flashnick](http://www.flashnickvisuals.com) also gave an insightful presentation about copyright from a photographers perspective. What happens when a blogger steals your content? Can you sue? Can you ask them to take the image down? What happens if you don't?

Brett also shared the copyright document "[Title 17](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sup_01_17.html)." If you have time to read it, you should check it out. It has everything you could ever know about copyright policies.

Here are the slides from last night's presentation:
