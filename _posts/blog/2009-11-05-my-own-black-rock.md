So Aaron showed me this secluded stop along the way to the BRP and I would have had no idea this place even existed if it weren't for him.  I almost forgot how to get there, but thankfully, since I get tagged one of my images on twitter with the location I was able to look it up in Google to find out exactly where I took the photo at if I ever wanted to return there.
