One of the things that I realized, with my sisters help is that taking care of children is no easy task.  They are everywhere!  Here, there, in the sand, in the water, playing with kids and running like crazy!  It was something else watching Trish chase elizabeth up and down wrightsville beach making sure nothing happened to her.  The I started wondering what it would be like for a parent who had twins, or quads!!!! Pure maddness!  
  
You have to love Jeremy, Trish and Elizabeth, they are all really great.[![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Rns85NeCRnI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/OMlZ27XiS7k/s400/IMG_1497.jpg)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Rns85NeCRnI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/OMlZ27XiS7k/s1600-h/IMG_1497.jpg)
