Today was a little bit of a better day.  It felt good outside, the air was crisp, but not too cool.  A call from my sister told me that the air was cooling off in Montreat quite a bit.  There was a little excitment around the office this afternoon, with the normal hustle and bustle of a newspaper.  
  
I love to sit at night and delve into the work of the other shooters at the paper.  Each shooter here has a natural given talent for some aspect of photography be it lighting, spot news, features, sports and everything else.  The colors, expressions, "decisive moments" leave me in awe on a daily/weekly basis.  Sometimes I just want to know how they got the shot.  
  
Here's a quite moment from the fair the other day.  There was a little old lady at the Oval Offfice display where you can have your picture taken and she was waiting for her son to fetch her wheelchair while I stood in front of her.  Almost on cue, she raised her hand in almost magical state as if she could read my mind and I snapped two shots off of her.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/fair1.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/fair1.jpg)
