One of the nice things to do after thanksgiving is to wake up and go shopping at 4:15 am.  Once of the not so nice things to do is try to wake me up to see if I want to go.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a great deal, but not at 4:15 am.  :)  This shot, fortunately, was taken much later in the day, around 8 hours later, down at the pier in the village.  This guy is a collector of old books.  I looked for a book for my friend, but after not finding it, I decided to buy an art book.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/1441/2633/400/116172/IMG_5929.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/16770/IMG_5929.jpg)
