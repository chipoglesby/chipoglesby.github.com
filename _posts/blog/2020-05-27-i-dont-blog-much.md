I use to love to write. It was one of my favorite things to do.
Looking at my site recently I realized I haven't written anything in one year
and seven months. But that's okay with me. I give myself not to write anything
on my website.

I've always felt like I need to publish something as much as possible, photos,
text or whatever and I've realized that's not what being creative is all about.
Working in newspapers, social media and websites have conditioned me to believe
that if you're not publishing daily you're irrelevant and that's just not true.
[I did create a subdomain of my photography, which you can find here.](http://photography.chipoglesby.com)

I'll always have my website and I'll always continue to publish things that I
think are interesting or may help someone solve the same problems I came across
in the future, but now I will do it without deadlines or time constraints.

The other thing that I want to share with you is that I've been fighting a
battle with cancer this year. I was diagnosed with breast cancer,
something that is not very common for men. [It affects about 1 in every 833 men
annually.](https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/male_bc) I've been
undergoing chemotherapy recently and I will continue to do that through the
summer.
