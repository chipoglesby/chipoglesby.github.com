[The Icarus Deception](http://vimeo.com/55128811) from Squarespace on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Watch this video and then watch it again, and then watch it again.

How did it make you feel? Were you excited? Scared? Ready to try something new?


## The plea:


Let this be the year that you try something different and chase your passion. Don't let anything or anyone stop you. I did the [same thing in 2011](http://www.creativesparkcolumbia.com) and it changed my life. I went from obese and miserable at my job to doing something that I loved every single day of the year.

I won't lie and b.s. it's been tough, one of the toughest things I've done. I've been scared too. There were days when even I thought I was crazy to step out on my own. But you know what? I don't regret it for one single second. I am proud of every decision that I've made and it was the best thing I could have ever done with my life.


## In life

My friend Mary struggled for a long time trying to find something that she could be passionate about. And she finally did. She spends every weekend and every free moment immersing herself in the sport of kayaking. I couldn't be more proud of her. She tackled life head on and now has more passion and zeal than I've seen in a really long time.

## In work


My friend Joe Bland also decided to make a change. With the help of a tribe of friends, he launched his first company this past year: [Raleigh Coffee Company](http://www.raleighcoffeecompany.com). He grew a hobby of roasting coffee beans from a passion into a full time job. He now serves up freshly roasted coffee to the Raleigh and surrounding areas and even sells his product online.

How amazing would it feel if you could take something that your passionate about and do it every day?

My friend Jeff started his own business [Columbia Wedding Photos](http://www.columbiaweddingphotos.com) after an untimely round of layoffs from The State Newspaper. Ask him and he'll tell you, its one of the best things that could have happened to him. More than three years later he has a very successful business where he wakes up and chases his dream every single day.

Austin Lee and his wife Courtney have also started their own business this past year. They started Front Porch Sweets and sell Gluten Free Goods.


## Conclusion


I started my business with [less than $100](http://100startup.com/) in my living room on a cold December morning. It took guts and patience, but I don't regret doing it.

I want you to do the same this year. No more B.S. resolutions. I want you to create real and lasting change. Don't be afraid of what others will say, it doesn't matter. This isn't their road, it's yours.

I want you to know that you're not alone. Every day people decide to make the big leap and try something new. Let today be your day.

I want you to know that you can do this. The time is right. The time is now.

I want you to create something amazing.

I want you to believe in yourself.

I want you to try.
