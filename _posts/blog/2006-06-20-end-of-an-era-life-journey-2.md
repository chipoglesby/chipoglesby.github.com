One of the things that I remember about Myrtle Beach as a kid was how cool it was to go to the pavilion.  I was surprised to see that this season was the pavilions last.  I'm sad to see it go.  I guess for the next generation it will be the hard rock theme park.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/_MG_1027.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/_MG_1027.jpg)
