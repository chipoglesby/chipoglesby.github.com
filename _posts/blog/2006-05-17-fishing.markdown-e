Under the Hwy 9 bridge.  I forced myself to go out and take photos.  When I was working as a staffer, I had no problem taking photos of people in public, there was a sense of purpose.  Now, it feels different somehow, like I shouldn't be doing it.  Still on the road to recovery, taking it one step and one photo at a time.  Still looking for a fulltime position.  Take care.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/fishing.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/fishing.jpg)
