The drive up to Mars Hill is usually an adventure.  Did you know that until this past weekend, I have never photographed any of the sights along the way?  four and 1/2 years in the Mountains, and I never really stopped to photograph them.  
  
One thing that I enjoy about being a photographer is that I can translate a scene that most people cannot record.  They will say "yeah, that's exactly how I saw it, but why didn't my photos turn out the same way?"  It's not that I have a magic trick or solution that I can't share, it's just that I have the experience of seeing what most don't.  Maybe they do see it, but I can record it.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/asheville.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/asheville.jpg)  
  
One of the exciting things about living near asheville is being able to go and explore the city.  There are a lot of interesting people there, but did you know that you have to pay to park almost everywhere?  I'm use to that in Charlotte, but I drove for nearly 20 minutes without finding a free parking spot!  I have always loved Tunnel Road, it's like the equivelant of Cherry Road in Rock Hill, if you can't find it there, you may not need it.  If it's not there, look on Merrimon, it will be there.  One of the cool things to do as a freshman is to drive through the Tunnel and honk your horn, or something that's just about as juvenile, but I do not reccomend trying to drive and photograph it at the same time, unless you are me, which you aren't.
