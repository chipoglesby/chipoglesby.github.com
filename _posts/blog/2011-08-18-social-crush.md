This post will be short, sweet and to the point. [Social Crush](http://socialcrush.com) was a very intense two day hands-on social media conference for Columbia, SC.

Monday featured a bootcamp that taught basic 101 information for Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. I taught the Twitter session and felt like there was some really great engagement with questions about how to compose tweets, how often someone should tweet and how to track analytics using services like bit.ly.

Tuesday we absolutely hit the ground running full speed! We covered every topic from 'like-gating' to geo-location services. The afternoon sessions featured more breakouts that covered Youtube, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and location based services. Social Media Club again volunteered to help lead some of these workshops. I was looking forward to hearing Skeeter Harris' Youtube talk, but I totally missed it.

I spent the day taking notes for Social Media Club. [You can find those here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XM7j2KOmvOZjEejynqzIVNSbfk-2AVVPfuCqLiFSvtA/edit?hl=en_US).

Wednesday was another full-speed hands on session that featured a keynote speaker from Hubspot as well as a great overview of blogging from the guys at Zementa.

All of my notes from Wednesday can be [found here as well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhiBsk3TfmuonZyhojw_7AiEkc-0MXRttk-pn87ryIU/edit?hl=en_US).
