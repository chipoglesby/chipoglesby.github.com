It's amazing how much a town can change in one year.

We went to Sapphire North Carolina this weekend to Gorges State Park to go hiking at Rainbow Falls. Since we were there last year, they've installed a large parking lot and a trailhead at the bottom of Drift Falls, about a 1.5 mile hike downhill and up to Turtleback falls. The last time we were there, we parked near the church parking lot and hiked down to Turtleback Falls, then down further to Rainbow Falls.

Here are some photos from this past weekend:

We also stopped in Brevard, North Carolina for lunch and Highlands North Carolina for dinner. These are both really great towns worth exploring.
