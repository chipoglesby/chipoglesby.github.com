As a Christian I believe in destiny.  The axe effect is what happened last week.  After almost two full years, I was fired on Thursday morning from the paper.  The reason being?  Good question.  It seems that my actions at the paper were viewed as "insubordinate" and my services were no longer need.  And, it hurt, and I cried.  I had put so much hard work and effort into honestly wanting to change the paper and change the way that people see things, that now, it seems so worthless, like I was never really needed.  
  
But the good thing about destiny is that everything happens for a reason.  We, must understand why it happens, because all we can truly control are our reactions.  People have asked me a lot of questions about the events that transpired at the paper, but to remain professional, I try not to answer them in bad light.  
  
I liked my job, I loved being able to explore the town and surrounding areas of lancaster, and I got paid to do it.  But in the end, it looks like that wasn't good enough for some.  So what did I do when I got fired?  What anyone else would do, I headed straight for our competiting papers, the Rock Hill Herald and Fort Mill Times, both owned by McClatchy.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/IMG_2916.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/IMG_2916.jpg)  
  
Sometimes, we lose sight of what's important to us.  It could be as simple as spending time with a loved one, holding their hand, or it could be a long walk down a trail, or relaxing in a hammock by the beach or under a shade tree, but in the 21st century, we have become so involved, we never know when to "turn off" or unplug.  Being fired really opened my eyes.  I realized that there is a world outside of me, and it's so much bigger than I will ever be, I should just go out and explore it.  Filing for unemployement really woke me up also.  For once in my life, I felt like I was at the bottom of the barrel with nowhere else to go.  To them, you aren't Chip Oglesby, ace photographer, you're just someone else in line, and I guess that's what I needed,  good kick in the pants!  
  
So to everyone out there, I will be ok, I will make it, because I believe that God has a plan for me, and for everyone else.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/eastertrish.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/eastertrish.jpg)  
  
Have a great day.  
  
And, now that I'm not shooting fulltime, I might not post as much, but I will be back!
