What an end to an amazing weekend!

This morning started out as a very cold and dreary day, but ended with the announcement by President Barack Obama that Osama Bin Laden had been killed.


<blockquote>[“For over two decades, bin Laden has been Al Qaeda’s leader and symbol,” the president said in a statement televised around the world. “The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat Al Qaeda. But his death does not mark the end of our effort. There’s no doubt that Al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html)</blockquote>


So after reading the news on facebook and twitter and following the Presidential address, I grabbed my camera and headed over to the White House. A short trip in a cab and I was ready to join the mob of people already assembled near the White House.

People were already gathered from the gates and filling most of Lafayette Square. Here's what the New York Times said about the event downtown:


<blockquote>The news touched off an extraordinary outpouring of emotion as crowds gathered outside the White House, in Times Square and at the Ground Zero site, waving American flags, cheering, shouting, laughing and chanting, “USA, USA!” In New York City, crowds sang the Star-Spangled Banner. Throughout downtown Washington, drivers honked horns deep into the night.</blockquote>
