Did you know? If you haven't heard the good news, [I'm getting married in March](http://www.chipoglesby.com/2012/08/marriage/)! My fiancee and I are both living in [Asheville, NC](http://www.chipoglesby.com/http://www.chipoglesby.com/tag/#asheville/). I'll have more to say about my time in [Columbia](http://www.chipoglesby.com/tags/#Columbia) and what I'll be doing next. Until then, have a great week!
