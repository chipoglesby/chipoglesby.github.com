I admit, I haven't been shooting much lately, and when I do, I'm so rusty that I feel like I shouldn't even be doing it! (Yikes!)  There are a lot of good things going on right now, so don't give up me just yet, I'll be going out this week and forcing myself to take some photos.  
  
I've also been working on three websites.  One for SCNPA, one for a coworker and one for myself.  They are all flashed based and pretty simple to maintain, so when they're ready to go, I'll let you know.  Here are three screen grabs of what they look like so far.
