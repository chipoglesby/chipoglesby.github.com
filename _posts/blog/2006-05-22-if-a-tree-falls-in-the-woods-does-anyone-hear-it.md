So, as you may or may not know, I am still looking for a fulltime job at another newspaper.  I have been working as a freelancer, and it helps pay the bills, but, I miss my old job.  Where I was, not such, but I do miss what I was doing.  As I went to the lily festval at Landsford Canal State Park, I thought about what I would say to the people I use to work for if I had the chance to run into on the streets.  Would I just play the "guilty by assocation" card, or would I be cordial?  Well I'll be dog-gone if I didn't run into the person that fired me today.  It took a lot not to say anything, just a smile and wave, that's all that I could muster.  
  
Yesterday was Joe's wedding.  He was my rommate from my freshman year at Mars Hill, and it seems like only yesterday we were hanging watching snow blow into the window during the winter.  It's funny how people grow up and grow apart and yet something like a wedding can bring them all back together like nothing has changed, but somehow it's different.  His wedding was amazing, it was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest and a reception at the Ciero Tise House off of 4th street.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/joewedding1.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/joewedding1.jpg)  
  
I would say that about 20 of his closet fraternity brothers were there and I thought that was great.  As usual, you always have a "core" group that will leave to pursue their own escapades.  But that's ok, it's not the first, and it won't be the last.  I'm happy for Joe, it seems like he and Jennifer will have a great life ahead of them.  A lot of people asked me about my relationship with Christy.  My answer?  "We'll see"  It seems like when you have things figured out, life throws you a curve ball, just to make sure that you're not asleep at the plate.  
  
It's time for me to do something, a interview a review or anyhting to keep my spirits up.  If I could do anything right now, I would love to do some international tavel and go to Haiti or an area that I could stand to make a difference.  But then I started thinking about it, if everyone has been there, how can I make a difference?  What could I say, what could I photograph that hasn't been done one million times by someone else?  And that's when it hit me, my heart is in community journalism and that's where I belong, and that's where I want to be.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/joewedding2.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/joewedding2.jpg)
