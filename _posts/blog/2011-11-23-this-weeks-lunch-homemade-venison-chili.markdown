A personal favorite of mine, something that I've made every winter since college and I'm going to share a/the recipe with you:



	
  * 1 quart of V8 (low sodium or extra spicy is fine).

	
  * 2 cans of chili beans, sauce included.

	
  * 1 can of kidney beans, sauce included.

	
  * 1 can of unsweetened corn.

	
  * 1 package of mushrooms.

	
  * 1 green bell pepper.

	
  * 1 yellow onion.

	
  * 1 package of lean venison stew meat.

	
  * 1 package of fresh ground pork sausage.

	
  * 1 package of 90/10 ground beef.

	
  * 1 package of chili 'mixing'.




Directions:








	
  1. Pour the V8 in a large soup pot and turn on medium low.

	
  2. Add chili mix and stir thoroughly.

	
  3. Cook meat, drain and add to pot.

	
  4. Dice bell pepper and add to pot.

	
  5. Add beans and corn to pot.

	
  6. Dice onion and caramelize in a skillet, add to pot.

	
  7. Caramelize mushrooms and add to pot.

	
  8. Adjust heat, cook until hot and serve.




Pretty simple right? Mine has some extras in it so I'll never share my real recipe but that's close enough.
