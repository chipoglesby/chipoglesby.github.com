[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.chipoglesby.com/Picture-2-300x144.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.chipoglesby.com/Picture-2.png)If you're in the social media world, you can't ignore its newest darling, Pinterest.

If you're a newspaper or a photojournalist, you can use this quick tip to see who's been pinning your work.

For this example, we'll use The State. Point your browser to [http://www.pinterest.com/source/thestate.com/](http://pinterest.com/source/thestate.com/)Â and you can quickly see who's been pinning your photos.

You can change the source to any site and it will still work. This is also a great tip for businesses who want to keep tabs on what people are saying about them on pinterest.

Enjoy and have fun pinning!
