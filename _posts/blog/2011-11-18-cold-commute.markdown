This mornings ride to work was easier than expected. It was 35 degrees at 8:15 this morning when I set out on my daily three mile commute to work.

It wasn't as bad as I expected. I was wearing two layers including a UnderArmour Coldgear Mock turtle and a t-shirt over that and a pair of dri-fit shorts by Nike and a pair of windproof gloves by REI.

I knew once I got moving that things would be better and I would be warmer. The hardest part of the commute was the cold wind on my face. That really stung, but the beard I'm growing helped a lot.

My future plan includes buying a softshell jacket and some leggings for when it's down in the teens, so I'm looking forward to that.
