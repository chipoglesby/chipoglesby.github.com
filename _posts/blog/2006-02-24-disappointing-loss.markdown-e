Buford played Calhoun County at Fairfield Central High School wednesday evening, and lost 70-40.  They made a strong comeback in the second half within 10 points, but couldn't pull off the win.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/bhsbasketball.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/bhsbasketball.jpg) I remember what it's like to be in high school, and loose a game that is really important to you.  
  
i was standing and watching Joel West who was being comforted by his mom Laura, when I was instally transformed back to my senior year at Indian Land.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/west.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/west.jpg)We played Mcbee for homecoming that year, the only game we had won the whole season, so far, and for me, it was bittersweet.  Knowing that it was a culmination of my high school football career quickly sent me to a depressive state following the win.    
  
Instead of celebrating with the rest of the team and being greeted by friends and family, I ran of the field in a horrible emotional state.  I remember running past my mom who was standing near the end zone, arms open and just making my way to the locker room, crying the whole time.  
  
As I look back on it now, I realize that probably wasn’t the best thing to do, but at the time, it was too much for me to handle.  When you’re in high school, you don’t realize that life will continue, and like most people’s experience it will be fine.  You get wrapped up in the feeling that this will never happen again and you try to savor every minute of it.    
  
There are more emotions in high school sports then just about any other level you will experience.  For some, it’s only the start of their career, but for most, it will be the end and they will play their hearts out, sweat blood, break bones, and enjoy every minute of it.  
  
Joel took me back to a time when playing sports meant something, not the glitz and glamour of pro athletes and not the over zealous individuals of college sports.  It was about the love of the game, the teamwork and dedication of many individuals that would carry their team further than any other Buford high school basketball team.  
  
I would like to see more athletes like West participate in high school sports and as long as they continue to play, the love of the game will continue.
