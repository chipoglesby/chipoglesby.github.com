That was my breaking moment on skype tonight. That thought echoed through my head


<blockquote>Why can’t I be like everyone else? I **just** want to be _like_ everyone else.</blockquote>


Things like that are tough for me. Tough for anyone who is overweight and feels out of place. Today was the first day in a long time when I did not feel like a champion.

I want to know what it feels like to be able to run faster than a 12 minute mile. I want to know what it feels like to run without a shirt on. I want to know what it feels like to be thin. I want this weight gone. Forever.

Losing weight is hard, harder than I ever imagined it would be.

Today was very, very tough emotionally.
