Well, today was a good day, I went to the judging contest and learned a lot about what kind of pictures not to enter.  I think only one of my photos made it to the second round then got 86'd after that.  Oh well, there's always tomorrow.  I ended up spending the afternoon with dan and becca catching up on old times.  It was cool.  Shhh, don't tell anyone, but I think they still like each other, I could be really wrong though, who knows.  
  
I was planning on going out and taking photos today, but it was crappy outside.  Who thought it would be crappy in Charleston?  But on the good side, I did get a Canon umbrella, and a nice one at that.  I've always wanted an umbrealla, and now I have one.  I almost lost it this afternoon.  The wind was blowing really bad and I was walking through the parking lot with it, trying to be cool, and then all of the sudden, this gust of wind blew it out of my hands, and I'm chasing it around the lot of the post and courier, I guess it was a sight to see.  
  
Here's today's photo, it's of me dan and becca at Wet Willie's having a few drinks, catching up on old times.  good stuff.  I wish Christy were here, that would be awesome, the four of us, together again.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/danbecca.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/danbecca.jpg)
