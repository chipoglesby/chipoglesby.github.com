The past few months have been a roller coaster of emotions for me. I took a break from training every day in November to focus on my business and get things back up and running. Then came Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Years. Then in February I moved to Asheville. On March 13th my father passed away. Then on March 17th I got married! (Best decision I've ever made!)

So what happened along the way? I fell off the bandwagon. I stopped swimming, biking and running everyday. I started using Michelle's car when I moved to Asheville and my weight crept back up on me. I went from a slender 355 and have now ballooned back up to a staggering 381.

It might not look like it, but I carry my weight pretty well. But it's become really tough on me mentally and physically.

So what do I do? I started back over. Now that our life is settling down, I am going to start riding my bike to work everyday. I've joined a local gym and I'm committing myself to going every other day, just like I did this past summer. I'm cutting out junk food, soda and carbs again. Just like I did this past summer. In other words, I'm getting back on the bandwagon.

I'm sharing this with you because I want you to know what's going on in my life. I want to hold myself accountable and keep the encouragement going. I feel into this position once and I don't want to do it again. I know it's going to be a long run but I'm looking forward to it. Michelle is helping me by getting me into a healthy weight management program at Mission Hospital.

I am still planning on running in the Half Ironman, as long as the doctor will clear me to do so by June. Until then it's time to hit the streets again.
