I got a comment from a friend that they don't "understand" some of my pictures.  I don't really know how to answer that.  I guess the easiest thing to say would be "learn to understand them" but that wouldn't be too nice of me.  
  
People who are non-photojournalist need to understand that a camera doesn't "see" the world the same way that you do.  It is my job as a photographer to show the world how to "see" and use a camera as my tool.  
  
Pictures don't always have to be easy to read.  Sometimes, they should be, other times, not, but the point is that someone should be taking them and in my town, that someone is me.  
  
This is a shot from a story we are working on, more to come later.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/cbprom.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/cbprom.jpg)
