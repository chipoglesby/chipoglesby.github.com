excerpt: It's interesting to go back and look at old cards and notes from the past.
  It's interesting to see what people were saying, how they felt and look at the design
  ideas of the time. The set of photos below are Valentines Cards my mother received
  as a child in the 1950's. She scanned them and sent them to me, so I thought I would
  share some of my favorites with you. Here thoughts and memories are below the card.

<blockquote>I love this one also. Another one to me from my log house cousins, Donny and Sonny Scott. One of my favorite childhood characters was Pocahuntas and the name of the coal mine where Daddy worked and the name of the town we lived in when I was born.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is another really old one. It is unique in that when opened up the back is also in full color print showing a boy seated on a stool with a bowl and a bubble wand blowing bubbles. On the inside it says "With Love for My Valentine" from Beatrice Mathena. I'm sure she must have been a relative of my dad but Momma and Daddy were not yet married.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the back, "to Pauline Johnson from Hawkins Brewster". I don't know that name but this is one of the really old ones also. Isn't it amazing how the color has held in these since they were stored in that cardboard box, all jumbled up, all those years? The boy's leg is partially missing but on the original you can still see his hands at the bottom.</blockquote>
