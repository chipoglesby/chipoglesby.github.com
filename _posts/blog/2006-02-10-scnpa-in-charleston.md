Well, I'm here, and after getting lost and sightseeing for a while, I took some photos and got back to the hotel.  Here are some pictures i took while I was lost.  The first one is from the battery, the second from rainbow road and the third is from the new bridge.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/charles1.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/charles1.jpg)
