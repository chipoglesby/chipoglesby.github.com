If you're like me, you may not always have access to a gym. So what are some exercises you can do around the house?

If you live in the country and have some old logs laying around, one of the best full body exercises is to go buy an axe and chop some wood!

This is a great way to work your entire body, including your core and it's also a great stress reliever!

Here's some video of me, it's actually the first video I've ever uploaded to youtube! Take a quick guess, how many times do you think it takes me to chop this log in half on the first try? One? Two? Three? Let's see!



What are your favorite exercises to do when you can't go to the gym?
