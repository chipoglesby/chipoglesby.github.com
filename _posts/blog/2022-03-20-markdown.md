Part of what I've been doing more of lately is writing documentation for various projects.
Its interesting all of the various formats files can be stored in. The most common are
probably word document files (Google & Microsoft), XLS (Microsoft Excel & Google Sheets) and
maybe PDF files. 

Somewhere along the mystical journey that is the internet,[John Gruber invented the markdown
format in 2004](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Why is Markdown important?
Imagine being able to write simple plain text documents with a minimal amount of syntax that
can be rendered by systems automatically.  This makes a document both human and machine readable
with a minimal amount of input from either side. 

Organize your thoughts:

1. Markdown is important because it can be created in any text editor or IDE.
2. There's no special or expensive software that requires vendor lock-in, IE Google, Microsoft, LibreOffice. 
3. Markdown can be used with version control systems such as Github & Bitbucket.
4. There are competing standards for Markdown, but you can pick one and stick with it.
5. It's good for data scientist because you can use tools like `R` to create automated reports. 
6. For documentation you can build entire ecosystems using tools like Github pages, Read The Docs and Gitbook.
7. So much has been abstracted for Markdown users since 2004 and its so simple to get up and running.
