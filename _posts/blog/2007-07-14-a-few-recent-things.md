One day at work, I got the chance to shoot some portraits at the studio here in the office for a band who sang some harry potter songs.[![](http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RphBiEuXTrI/AAAAAAAAAFw/MZ9y2Q6E4e0/s400/potter.jpg)](http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RphBiEuXTrI/AAAAAAAAAFw/MZ9y2Q6E4e0/s1600-h/potter.jpg)  
  
This shot is from Julie and Stuart's baptism of Rachel Graham.
