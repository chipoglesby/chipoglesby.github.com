On Friday my friend Mary and I decided to go try out the new HIIT class at the local YMCA.


<blockquote>**High-intensity interval training** (**HIIT**) or **sprint interval training** is an [exercise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise) strategy that is intended to improve performance with short training sessions. HIIT is a form of [cardiovascular exercise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_exercise) which is beneficial to burning fat in a short and intense workout.</blockquote>

## Bring on the delayed onset muscle sorneness!


Saturday morning was the most pain I've been in since the last time I hit a weightroom full force in college. During that time I was muscle bound for about 2 weeks. I could hardly lift my backpack. Saturday was no different. My legs were killing me and felt like jelly!
Instead of sitting around whining about it, I hopped on my bike and went for a quick two mile ride around my neighborhood to get loosened up.

Before going to bed I popped some anti-inflammatory meds and iced down my screaming quads before dosing off to sleep. Sunday seems a bit better. My legs are still sore, but not as bad.

Like all good things, I should know better than to hop into any class called "high intensity" and just start going crazy, it's something that I've got to work up to.

Without a doubt I'll join the YMCA so I can start doing laps and building up my cardio before I go to anymore classes.
