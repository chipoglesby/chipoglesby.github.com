I should start by saying that I don't speak Spanish and I certainly cannot translate it, but I thought it would be a fun exercise to see if I could programmatically translate cells in Google Spreadsheets from English to Spanish. This script uses Google Translate to automatically translate sentences after they're typed into a spreadsheet. It could be helpful for writing Spanish ads for Google Adwords.

I've read a few articles on how reliable the translations are. Is anyone familiar with how accurate the translations are? If you're proficient with English & Spanish and care to take a look, let me know your thoughts on if this actually works.
