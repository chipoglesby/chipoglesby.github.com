While going through all of these life changing decisions, I've realized that sometimes in life, we have to take risks. I don't mean silly risks like driving with our eyes closed. I'm talking about risks that if they work, it has such a huge potential reward for us! But why is it so hard for us to get over ourselves?

This past week, Walter Issacson, author of the new Steve Jobs bio, gave a lecture about his new book. I think everyone in the room was really inspired by what a visionary Jobs was. I know I was. It was amazing to hear that Jobs was referred to as "petulant" because I can relate to that. There's been more than once in my professional career that I wanted to jump through the roof when I feel like someone wasn't understanding what I was telling them. I learned how to calm my expectations over time though.

When you think about it though, life is short and we only get one. The world needs our time , talent, ideas and passion. Do you want to sit behind a desk all day or do you want to go out into the world and create? Do you want to sit by on the sidelines and watch others live their dreams? Do you want to be an passive view in an active game?** I'm doing something about it and I hope you'll join me along the way!** The next time you look yourself in the mirror, ask yourself this: Â "Am I living my life the way that I want?"
