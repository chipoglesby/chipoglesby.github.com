Every once in a while you need to stop and ask yourself “Am I truly happy with what I’m doing?” If the answer is no, you need to figure out what you can change so that you will be happy.

I’ve decided to do that. I’ve worked for The South Carolina Policy Council since June of 2010. It was my first experience with a think tank and politics. I learned more about free market economics and capitalism then I ever thought possible. Most of all I learned that small business owners are the life blood of our economy.

I’m not sure why people aren’t taking risks right now, but I don’t want to be one of them. Right now more than ever the world needs our talent, our passion our voice and I’m going to start contributing to that.

First it was getting rid of the car, then buying the bike, then training for the triathlon, now I’ve decided that as of January 1, 2012 I will be going into business for myself.

I’m launching a digital strategy company that focuses on three things: Analytics, Search Engine Optimization and brand reputation and implementation through social media.

Right now in Columbia there is a need for people who can help analyze traffic reports and help educate businesses on the ROI of social media. There are plenty of people who want to run your social media campaigns, I’m not one of them. I want to take your business to the next level and educate you on how you can reward loyalty to your super fans on these networks.

This is an exciting opportunity and I’m really excited about it.

It’s time for me to step out in the world and become the person I was meant to be. Let’s go out and create something great, shall we?
