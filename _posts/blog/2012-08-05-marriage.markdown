Meet the love of my life and my best friend for the past four years, Michelle Gambill!

Michelle and I have been close friends for four years. We started dating in May of 2012 and I knew on our first date that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

I proposed on Monday July 23rd while on vacation in Asheville and it took her by surprise. As I've learned in life, nothing went as planned, not in a bad way, but everything was perfect because she said "YES!!!!"![](https://storage.googleapis.com/www.chipoglesby.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/473574_569253056207_1819394905_o.jpg)
