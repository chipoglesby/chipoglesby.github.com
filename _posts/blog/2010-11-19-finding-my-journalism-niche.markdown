Ok, it's time to get serious about this site, no really!

Starting next week I'll be doing a weekly column every Friday called **[online tools for small news organizations](http://www.chipoglesby.com/category/journalism/tools-journalism/).**

**Since I've worked in small and medium sized newspapers my whole life, this is the market that I know best. I also know online journalism tools pretty well. I'm also fed up with crappy news sites that just don't work.**

So I'm going to give back to society and do my civic good. I'm going to share everything that I know with you.

This will serve as an online repository for all my collective knowledge. I'm going to help you build and produce a better online news site with a small or limited budget.

It doesn't matter if you're a small daily, weekly or even a nonprofit, this will help you improve your online presence.

Next week's post will focus on building a content management system through [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org).
