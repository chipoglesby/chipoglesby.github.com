I realized that it's been a while since I've written anything personal on the blog about where I am in my life right now so I thought I would give it a shot.

It's January, and I'm seven months, one day from the triathlon. A lot has changed since December, some bad but mostly good.

I quit my job at SCPC and started my own company which has given me more freedom and responsibility then I could ever imagine. I joined the YMCA officially and I've been going on a regular basis which is also great.

The one thing that needs improvement is setting, and sticking to a schedule. That's always my weakness. I need to be exercising and going to the Y everyday, but sometimes I end up working from 9 am until 2 am. Â That's just not a pace that I can keep up.

It's hard to believe that I've been on my own now for four weeks. It doesn't seem like it's been that long. Last Wednesday I had a day where I broke every personal record. I biked 7 miles, ran/walked 6 miles, swam twelve full laps and did a full body workout. That seriously took 1/2 of a day.

Not to complain, but I need to figure out how people have the time to do all of this. Do you have any suggestions of how I can create a schedule and stick to it everyday?
