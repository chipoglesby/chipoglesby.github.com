Today was my final day in Charleston and the end of the SCNPA seminar.  We had three great speakers who gave me a lot of insight about what the future holds for photographers and about what we can look foward to doing.  I went and drove around for a while afterwards snapping pictures.  Enjoy.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/charleston2.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/charleston2.jpg)
