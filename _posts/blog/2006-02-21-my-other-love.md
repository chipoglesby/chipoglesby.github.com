That title sounds bad, and although I do love photography, I have another love in my life.  This beautiful face is a source of daily inspration for me.  She's the one that keeps me going, lifts me up when I fall and tells me that she loves me constantly.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/christy220.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/christy220.jpg) until next time...
