The past two months have been unbearable for me. It  
seems that every day ends before it can actually  
begin. I went down to the beach on a spur of the  
moment trip by myself hoping that I would actually  
find something, or at least figure something out.   
From my house to the beach is a three hour trip and it  
gave me a lot of time to think. Things have changed,  
what seemed so right now feels wrong, and while I want  
to go forward, I always end up traveling backwards. I  
left at noon armed with only my camera and the  
slightest idea of what I wanted to accomplish. I  
would return late and go to bed at 5:00 am the next  
morning. Here's what I saw along the way (in no  
particular order).[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/_MG_1160.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/_MG_1160.jpg)
