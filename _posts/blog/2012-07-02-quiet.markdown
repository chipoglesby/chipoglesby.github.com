Yes, that's right. I'm still here and I'm still working out everyday. Recently I've begun to get up at 4:30 am and go running six miles in the morning before work. I don't always want to, but I force myself to get out of bed and go do it anyways.

I've been posting record milage on Fitbit. In July of 2011, I was walking an average of 1.79 miles per day. In June of 2012, I was walking an average of 6.79 miles per day. That's quite the increase!

I've also signed up for the Lake Lure Triathlon and the Color Run 5k in Charlotte, which is in November. I did it at the same time and it felt great to sign up for something like both of these events! There's no turning back now!

In addition to the six to twelve miles I'm doing daily, I'm also biking on a daily basis and swimming as well.
