> Summary: I moved from Wordpress to Github pages for security, speed and ease
> of use.

I've been tinkering with website since 2000 when I helped my sister build her
first webpage.

Originally I had an Angelfire site that I outgrew, then I moved my site to
Blogger. After that I built my first real site using Wordpress back in 2008
and I fell in love.

For a long time Wordpress suited me very well. It was a simple Content
Management System that let just about anyone build a website without knowing
the ins and outs of coding, HTML and CSS and for a long time it worked great.

At some point though, things became more difficult to manage with Wordpress.
At first it was site speed, so I used W3 Total Cache. Then spam comments became
a problem. Then Wordpress sites started getting hacked. Then plugins started
getting hacked and it all became too much.

[Two years ago](http://www.chipoglesby.com/2014/07/i-finally-git-it/) I started
teaching myself how to use Git. As I became more comfortable with it, I learned
more about Github and all of the things that came with it. Once I started seeing
people with these `github.io` pages, I became really interested in what they
were doing.

During that time I learned more about static generated sites, Jekyll and Github
pages.

Although I'm far from being an expert, I'm starting to master this a little
bit at a time.

I'm also excited that I can produce blog posts now in plain text editors as well
as RStudio!
