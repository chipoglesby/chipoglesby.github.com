We started our food tour on Monday with Lunch at [Dumpling House](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=dumpling+house+nyc&fb=1&gl=us&hq=dumpling+house&hnear=nyc&cid=6901661319164401509) in the [Lower East Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side). The pork scallion pancakes were amazing and for two dollars, you can't beat it.  From there we hopped over to [Rice to Riches](http://www.ricetoriches.com/), a great rice pudding shop in [SoHo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo). From there we skipped around town traveling between SoHo, NoLita, and Little Italy. We made our final stop on the food tour at [Vosges Haut Chocolat](http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/) and picked up the most amazing thing ever, a [Mo's Bacon Bar](http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/mos-milk-bacon-bar/milk-chocolate-bars). This chocolate bar has applewood smoked bacon, Alder wood smoked salt and chocolate. Yumm!
