Given my current situation with my car, I decided that now might be a good time to look into buying an electric car.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. [The Nissian Leaf](http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index?next=header.vlp.postcard.picture.thumbnail.#/leaf-electric-car/index) gets 100 miles on one charge.

There's even the [Chevy Volt](http://www.chevrolet.com/volt/) which is a gas/electric hybrid. It gets 35 miles on an electric charge and 340 miles additional mileage on gas.

The idea of having a fully electric car in the city is very appealing. My average commute to work is 6 miles round trip so I would be there perfect audience.

But what happens if I want to go out of town? How far could I really make it?

I built the map below that shows all electric car charging stations in South Carolina.



Data provided by [Plug-in Carolina](http://www.plugincarolina.org/).

As you can see, it's very sparse. There are stations in Greenville, Union, Spartanburg, York (Rock Hill), and Columbia.

If you were to buy a Leaf your travel options would be very limited. [Greenville Â is 103 miles away](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbia+SC&daddr=Greenville+SC&hl=en&ll=34.427302,-81.713562&spn=1.225608,2.705383&sll=34.47372,-81.50173&sspn=1.224943,2.705383&geocode=FUbPBgIdwoEr-ynj0TF5aaX4iDGW-nmz9Ago8w%3BFQrPEwIdZsQW-ykFEfpiZo9XiDGWdiW_d52q2A&mra=ls&z=9) from Columbia. [Spartanburg is 93 miles](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbia+SC&daddr=Spartanburg+SC&hl=en&sll=34.463542,-80.996704&sspn=1.225076,2.705383&geocode=FUbPBgIdwoEr-ynj0TF5aaX4iDGW-nmz9Ago8w%3BFb9JFQId8NAd-ykLRpemGZ5XiDHJftrKOCiLWw&mra=ls&z=9) away, [Rock Hill is 68 miles](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbia+SC&daddr=Rock+Hill,+SC&hl=en&sll=34.463542,-80.996704&sspn=1.225076,2.705383&geocode=FUbPBgIdwoEr-ynj0TF5aaX4iDGW-nmz9Ago8w%3BFUPpFAIdyqcr-yll-8pFqoxWiDHwiQzlRYx6xw&mra=ls&z=9) away and [Union is 72 miles](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbia+SC&daddr=Union+SC&hl=en&ll=34.357042,-81.329041&spn=1.226637,2.705383&sll=34.463542,-80.996704&sspn=1.225076,2.705383&geocode=FUbPBgIdwoEr-ynj0TF5aaX4iDGW-nmz9Ago8w%3BFRS3EQIdYYUi-ymniuTkf7FXiDGoHIfEqLW3FQ&mra=ls&z=9).

Granted, these are towns that provide dedicated charging stations and you can still plug your car in at a friend's house but will that stop you from traveling with your electric car?

Here's another Google Map I've found by a user, Jim, while searching for EV stations. His map has a few extra additions my doesn't.

So the big question is, **with most large towns spread out around South Carolina will you be willing to take the risk of traveling to these towns in a fully electric town?**
