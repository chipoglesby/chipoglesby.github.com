I apologize for my lack of activity on this site. As most of you know, I started my own business in December of 2011 and I've been working on it full time since then. 

I'm still riding my bike everyday. I've also started walking at least 5 miles everyday. I'll admit, I've stopped swimming as much as I should and I feel awful about that. 

I do still go to the gym for HIIT class at least twice a week as much as possible, so that's going well also.

Just to let you know things are working out. Here's a before and after photo of me from recently. I wish I could tell you exactly how much weight I've lost, but I have no idea. Let's just focus on keeping up the good work!
