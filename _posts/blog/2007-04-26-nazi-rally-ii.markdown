The thing that was most surprising were the signs that protesters were holding.  As emotions ran high, so did the responses from the protesters to the neo-nazi group.

It was surreal this was happening in my own backyard.[![](http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ri_9RYP8dVI/AAAAAAAAADE/W9O8dXfiS70/s400/nazi04.jpg)](http://bp2.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ri_9RYP8dVI/AAAAAAAAADE/W9O8dXfiS70/s1600-h/nazi04.jpg)
