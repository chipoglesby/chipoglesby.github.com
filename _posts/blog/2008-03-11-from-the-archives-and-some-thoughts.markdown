In the past few months, I've laid down my camera and it sat in my room gathering dust, only to be used on occasion.  When I was in college, my dream was to be a photographer.  It's been hard lately, because I haven't felt that way and I can't figure out why.  
  
When I worked in Lancaster, I felt like I was finally learning to see.  Learning to see the world differently from most people and I'm ready to start feeling that way again.  I'm ready to push away from the computer on my days off and go out and explore the world with the passion that I use to carry in my heart.[![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDVJPssI/AAAAAAAAAOs/7xve2zaJfkA/s400/IMG_8102.jpg)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDVJPssI/AAAAAAAAAOs/7xve2zaJfkA/s1600-h/IMG_8102.jpg)  
  
It's time for me to start being creative again.  
  
The reason for doing this is simple.  In the day and age of twitter, facebook, emails and all sorts of technology, it's easy to get caught up and constantly being on the computer.  
  
It started out simply enough for me.  First came the day that I realized that I spent most of my time awake on or near a computer.  It's what I do for a living as an online producer and that cannot be ignored.

Then I realized that instead of picking up a phone to actually contact someone, I would use email, facebook, im or twitter to reach the intended person.  I started craving the old ways of reaching people, handwritten letters and personal telephone calls.  
  
After that came the great 48 hours of "disconnect" where I spent my whole weekend away from the computer, which brings me to where I am today.[![](http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPsuI/AAAAAAAAAO8/gsshqKX93fw/s400/IMG_8370.jpg)](http://bp1.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/R9YvDlJPsuI/AAAAAAAAAO8/gsshqKX93fw/s1600-h/IMG_8370.jpg)  
  
Starting in Janurary sometime, I set a limit to no more than 15 minutes on the computer before or after work.  The one time that I do get on the computer for more than that is on Friday's to watch LOST.  I've started reading more books and I've also started keeping a personal journal.  I now also walk three miles a day and that makes me happy :)

One your a member of my family or your one of my close friends who I've given this link to or two, you've stumbled on this blog by accident or found it through some other means.    
  
I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and letting me photograph you constantly!  
  
Thank you!
