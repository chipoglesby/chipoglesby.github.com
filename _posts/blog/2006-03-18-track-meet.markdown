I love shooting track meets, in my opinion they are one of the most action packed events you can attend.  Since I have some form of adult add, it's good for me also, so I can constantly move around and shoot something different.  [![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/trackmeet.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/trackmeet.jpg)I've been waiting all season to shoot the men's/women's high jump, but they always do that event last, after the sun has set and the "golden" light is gone.  Here's one from the men's 100 meter high hurdles.  We can't use it for the paper, no faces = no play.  Enjoy!
