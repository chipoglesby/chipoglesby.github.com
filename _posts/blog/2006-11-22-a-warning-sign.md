A warning sign,   
It came back to haunt me and I realized,   
That you were an island and I passed you by,   
And you were an island to discover.   
  
Come on in,   
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in,   
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones,   
That I started looking for a warning sign.   
  
When the truth is,   
I miss you.   
the truth is,   
That I miss you so.   
  
And I'm tired,   
I should not have let you go.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/l1015.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/l1015.jpg)
