Widespread played their last two shows at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Charlotte and there were a lot of different "types" of people there.  This was one of the more interesting characters. [![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RrUcEz1OzzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/P7VFtzLTWZE/s400/IMG_2261.jpg)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/RrUcEz1OzzI/AAAAAAAAAGE/P7VFtzLTWZE/s1600-h/IMG_2261.jpg) Apparently, this guy lost his shoe at some point during Friday nights concert and was wanting to know if anyone had seen it.  He was also taking up a collection to buy himself another "shoe".  So my question is, Why is your one shoe still so new?  The laces haven't even been taken out yet?  
  
Another interesting character was a mother and her daughter who sported a sandwich sign that said "give me money to get my deadbeat daddy out of jail."  Righttt....if he's in jail, why are you at a panic show collecting money?  Why don't you have a job?  I've got two, can't you get one?  Any who...
