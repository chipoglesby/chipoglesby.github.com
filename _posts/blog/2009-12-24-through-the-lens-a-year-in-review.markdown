A look back through 2009 in photos.

2009 was a very busy year for me personally and professionally. It will always be remembered as the year that "all of my friends got married."  In addition to staying busy, my camera spent a lot of time sitting in a bag because my lens (17-85 f4-5.6) didn't work half of the time. I'm working on getting that fixed now. At least it still shoots.

This year was a really off year for travel as well. I usually spend my summer traveling between Charleston and Asheville which I didn't do much of this year.

I hope that in 2010 I'll be able to some trips and spend time doing some actual shooting.

Enjoy the images below, I'll have a couple more to add before January 1, 2010, until then Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
