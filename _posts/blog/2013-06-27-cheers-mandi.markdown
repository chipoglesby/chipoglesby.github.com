That's how Columbia's #famouslyhot [Mandi Engram](http://www.twitter.com/mandiengram) described herself in her twitter profile. We first met in 2008 while creating the first South Carolina chapter of Social Media Club. We always talked about social media strategy and how to move Columbia forward.

One of my favorite conversations that I constantly had with Mandi was how to prevent what we called 'brain drain.' We both felt that we had a vested interest in keeping young, bright, talented people in Columbia. We wanted to grow the city and grow it's base. I guess that's one problem neither of us were able to solve.

Quite and reserved offline, boisterous and outgoing online. That's how I remember Mandi.

Mandi, thank you for all you've contributed to make Columbia a better place. I wish you the best of luck as you begin your new job. Come visit us sometime!
