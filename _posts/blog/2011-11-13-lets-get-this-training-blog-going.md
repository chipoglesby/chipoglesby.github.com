As most of you've read on my main site, I've given up my car and started commuting by bike on a daily basis. A few weeks ago, my friend Michelle put the idea of doing a triathlon in my head.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized I should really do it. I mean, why not, right?

So here we are today, as I set out to start training for my first triathlon. This blog will serve as a place to highlight my accomplishments, pitfalls and everything that comes along with training.

Let's get started!
