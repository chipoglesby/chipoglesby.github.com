It has been quite around here, maybe a little too quite.  I haven't made a single post since Nov 13th, that's a long time!  
  
I apologize, things have been pretty hectic lately at home and work and I'm finally settling into my new job as an online producer for thestate.com.  
  
I took some photos last night at the Christmas eve service and I will be posting those soon.  I hope everything is well and I wish you all a merry Christmas!
