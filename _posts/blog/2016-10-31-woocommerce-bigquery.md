Here's a good way to upload data from an ecommerce store's API using hourly updates. Here's what I did.

You can easily run this code on a linux based machine or Google Compute Engine using an hourly `crontab`.

For the two files below, I created a folder for them to both go into.
The first script uses `jq`, a command line processor. Since Google BigQuery only accepts new-line delimited JSON files, you can use `<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>` and set the -c flag to convert the results to that format.

You'll need to update the `xxxx`Â information with your own data.

This JSON file below is the actual schema you'll use in your BigQuery table.
