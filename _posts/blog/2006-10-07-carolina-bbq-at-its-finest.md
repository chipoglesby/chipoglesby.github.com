This is a great weekend to be in Columbia.  There are many events going on around town, the air is crisp, the light is beautiful, and the people are nice.  Maybe it's because fall is here and halloween is around the corner, I'm not sure what it is, but I am enjoying it, I was even able to sleep with my bedroom windows open last night.  
  
I woke up this morning ready to go to two events today, a cop doughnut eating contest and a walk for life.  I was renewed with the idea of taking photos for the second time in three months.  The first event that I wanted to go to was at Finlay park, I had just seen it the other day, but where?  After driving around for 20 minutes on the wrong side of town, I called Maxie and found out that it was behind the post office, of course!! That's where I saw it the other day, at the post office.  But why would they be having a walk for life on Friday morning when most people are at work? Actually, why are either one of these events happening on Friday, when most people are at work?  I didn't know, and I didn't care, because I was going to take some great photos, even if I was a little late from oversleeping.  
  
Once I arrived at these events, I realized when I didn't see anyone that it must be tomorrow when these things are going on.  One quick look at today's newspaper and sure enough, in my frenzy to photograph something, I didn't realize the dates were for Saturday, can you blame me though, I don't even wear a watch!  
  
So this afternoon proved to be better as I headed to the Carolina BBQ Cup at the farmers Market.  The fragence of fresh muskadines danced through the air with hickory smoke from the cue. Here is one photo from today, Enjoy![![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/400/IMG_3914.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/1441/2633/1600/IMG_3914.jpg)
