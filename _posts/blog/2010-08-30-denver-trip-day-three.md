By day three of my Denver trip, my constant on the go pace had finally caught up with me.

After I checked-in to my hotel, I had to muster up the strength to go find lunch. I really just wanted to crash and sleep.

One of the most interesting sights that I found along the way were the pianos that sat out in the open for people to play. There were some very talented homeless people who could really play. It makes me wonder, how did they get into that situation and yet the can play such beautiful music?

I pushed on though, spending most of the morning exploring the 16th street mall, looking for good photo ops.
