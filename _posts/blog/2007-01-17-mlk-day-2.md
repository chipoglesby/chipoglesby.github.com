Here's my second shot from the King Day at the Dome in Columbia on Monday.  I like this photo better in black in white because I think it makes a stronger impact then the muted yellows of the signs and dead grass.  I also think that the sign works as a bridge between the two boys, linking them together.[![](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ra2xkl9mcOI/AAAAAAAAAGk/-1U95SeIwtg/s400/MLK07.JPG)](http://bp3.blogger.com/_GlcbreYSTwI/Ra2xkl9mcOI/AAAAAAAAAGk/-1U95SeIwtg/s1600-h/MLK07.JPG)
