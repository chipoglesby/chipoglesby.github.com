You may or may not believe that [Global Warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) is real, but one thing we can all agree on is how much it's been snowing these past two years!

I did some digging around on Google and [found exactly how much it's snowed](http://www.sercc.com/cgi-bin/sercc/cliMAIN.pl?sc1939). 2009-2010 placed third in 63 years with an annual snowfall of 8.9 inches. It hasn't snowed this much in 37 years!

I've made this nifty chart for you below to see for yourself:
