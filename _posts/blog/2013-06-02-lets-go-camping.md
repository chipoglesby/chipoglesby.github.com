We took our first camping trip together this weekend. We had a great time at [Cascade Lake](http://www.cascadelakerecreationarea.com/). Saturday was the perfect day to go camping as well. We had a huge tent with plenty of room; plenty of yummy food and drinks and we even roasted smores by the fire.

I learned how to play two new card games: skip-bo and fluxx. My bathing suit even got nibbled on by a fish when we went swimming in the lake.

At 4:30 in the morning, I heard something hit the rain tarp. Then it hit again and again and then the bottom fell out of the sky. It was raining. Michelle and I had a conversation yesterday about whether or not we needed the rain tarp. She siad it wouldn't hurt to use it, so I'm glad we had it up.

The photo below is a time-lapse photo of me writing my name with burning embers from the fire.
