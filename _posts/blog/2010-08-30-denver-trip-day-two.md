I spent the second day of my denver trip in the sleepy town of Frisco Colorado from the recommendation of a coworker.

Frisco is a small quaint town that sits near Silverthorne and Breckenridge and sandwiched between Chief Mountain and Lake Dillon.



Saturday evening I went to my first Major League Baseball game as the Colorado Rockies defeated the L.A. Dodgers.
