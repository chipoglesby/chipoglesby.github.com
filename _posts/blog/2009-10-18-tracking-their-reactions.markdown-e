This is my attempt to track the reactions of University of South Carolina football fans as they take on the Alabama Crimson Tide. Are they general loyal fans or do their reactions ebb and flow with the Gamecocks performance? Let's see. For this experiment I'm using Cover it Live and keyword searches on Twitter.  This experiment would be more interesting if I were able to use Twitter's Geo-location API to hone in on the exact location of the stadium.

One note, I was only able to search for "USC" and not "USC AND not Notre Dame" so there are also tweets about the other USC in here as well.
