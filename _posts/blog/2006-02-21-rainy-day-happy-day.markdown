I spent the day with Christy today down in Columbia, our state's capital.  It was rainy and nasty, but, being with the person you love makes that all go away.  She's in town for a concert tuesday night with USC and a big group of other people, along with 50 people from her college.

One thing that I wish I would have done more of, was take more pictures in college of my friends, I guess I'm trying to make up for it now.    
  
We took a tour of the state house grounds and took photos along the way, in the rain, it was nice for a change, to be able to photograph something without the pressures of deadlines.  Walking in the rain was also nice, it was a great reason to walk really close together, share an umbrella and enjoy each others company.  
  
Until better weather comes along, enjoy!
