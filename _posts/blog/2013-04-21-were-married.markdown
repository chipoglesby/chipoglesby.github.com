Yeah, I know, I'm a month late on posting these photos. Michelle and I had an amazing wedding and have been enjoying our first month of marriage. We would like to thank all of our family and friends that made this day possible. We would also like to thank our wedding planner, Casey Slate and our amazing photographer [Gerry Melendez](http://www.gerrymelendez.com) for the amazing job he did documenting our wedding. 

Here are just a few of the photos. Enjoy the slideshow below.
