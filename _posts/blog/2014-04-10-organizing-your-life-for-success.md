When was the last you said no to someone who asked you to do something for them? This is a problem that we face constantly. We take on more and accomplish less. **_We should never over promise and under deliver._**


Recently I started breaking down things into three columns. I want to share with you how I prioritize things and accomplish more.


Those three columns are:






	
  1. Could be done

	
  2. Should be done

	
  3. Needs to be done


**Column one**: Could be done: In life and in work, this is where you would write down anything that could be humanly possible that you want to accomplish. Short term goals and long term goals apply here.

**Column two**: Should be done: From the list in column one, what should you actually be doing? Consider the time and resources you currently have. Is it possible? Is it something tha you can easily accomplish right now? Is something that’s doable, but maybe in the future? Write it down here.

**Column three**: Needs to be done: Considering the current load of work that you have to accomplish in the immediate future, what in column two needs to be accomplished or completed right now? Add only what is essential right now and do those tasks today. Don’t put things off until tomorrow because they’ll never be completed. Do only what you can accomplish today. When you’re done, remove it from the list and add something new from column two and repeat until you’re done.

**Remember**: Some things will stay in column one or column two for a long time. If column one or two is always empty, you’re not dreaming or thinking big enough.

What are some of the things you want to accomplish?
