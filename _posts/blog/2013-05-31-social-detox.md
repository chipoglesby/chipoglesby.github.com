I'm taking a step back from Facebook, Twitter and Google+ during the month of June. If you need me, I can be reached by email or phone.

I will be focusing on creating more than consuming. I'll be trying to write and take more photographs, focusing on my business and my family.

Hopefully this will bring me some much needed clarity.
