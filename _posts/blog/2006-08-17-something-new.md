So I recently started my new job as Night Picture Editor at The State Newspaper (http://www.thestate.com) a little over one month ago.  I also just relocated down to Columbia to be closer to work, no more 1 hour drives to work! But yeah, for those who care, I really like my job.  It's not like being a photographer, which I miss, but it does give me time outside of work for my own projects, that I may post on here eventually.  One thing that I do enjoy, is that for once, I know when I will get off of work and when I'll start, no more 13 hour days.  Here is a recent picture, my sister Trish took it, it's of me and her daughter Elizabeth.  She's a precious baby.[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/400/baby.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3124/2183/1600/baby.jpg)  I hope everyone is doing well and I'll try to keep on posting my work!
