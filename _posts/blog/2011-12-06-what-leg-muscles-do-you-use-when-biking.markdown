I found this on tumblr tonight. I hate to post something without giving proper credit to the creator, but I guess it's covered under fair use. I thought this was kind of cool because you can see which muscles you're using while you're actually pedaling. 

I'm curious to know if this changes when you have clipless pedals? I've also been trying to practice "bricking" after work. That's where you go out for a ride and then immediately drop off your bike and go running. Between this and the couch to 5k program, I hope to be able to start running more efficiently ASAP.
