## First let's get this out of the way
Ah the great language wars of the past three years where we waxed poetically
over using R vs Python for data analysis. Enough digital ink has been spilled
to last us for ever, so here is what I think:

> If you're a programmer and you want to get into data science, you'll want to
learn Python. If you're an established data analyst or classic statistician,
you'll want to learn R.

I say that mainly because of the mechanics of the languages themselves and not
what they actually do. You can write crappy code in either and it's still
crappy.

## I don't think it really matters what language you use
Really, I don't. I find that one of the best ways to stay on top of job trends
is to constantly look at what my favorite companies are looking for in
candidates.

Recently I came across a post that said something like `Strong programming
ability (Python, consideration given for R).` I found that rather interesting.

I guess if you don't take standardization into account I don't know why it would
matter if you use `R` or `Python`. If I were hiring you for a position, I'd
rather know that you can solve problems in whatever language needs to be used,
within reason.

I've been trying to think of a good reason why you might only want a candidate
that knows a specific language? `R` for example has `caret` and `Python` has
`scikit learn`. If you know the basics of one, you should be able to dive-in and
debug a piece of code if your coworker is having a problem.

I think that companies like [StitchFix do a great job of letting their employees
use whatever tools they need to get the job done](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/17/grammar-of-data-science/).

## Why

I care much more about your ability to think programmatically and solve problems
than I do the language you do it in. Yes there is beauty in code and in the
world of business a lot of times we just need to G.S.D. (Get Shit Done).
