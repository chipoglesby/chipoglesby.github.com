So it's raining in Columbia today, not the best time for me to go out and run laps around the neighborhood. I will end up going and riding my bike before the day is over, but that's a different story.

I was having a discussion last night with someone about what we can do to keep in shape when it's cold and raining outside. The idea of working out in our homes came up.

I don't know about yall, but most of the time when I'm at home, that's the last time I actually want to workout. It's my sanctuary where I just go to relax and rest my mind at the end of the night.

Now that I'm not in an office 40 hours a week, things are different. I did some digging on youtube and found a set of videos from trainer Amanda Russell. These are some quick 15 minute drills you could do in your living room or anywhere you've got plenty of room to move around. Until I can make it to the gym again when it's not raining this will have to do!
