Personal:

I’m Chip Oglesby and I’m a small business owner and former award winning photojournalist. I’m orginally from Van Wyck, SC and I currently live in Fort Collins, Colorado with my amazing wife Michelle.

I attended Mars Hill College and have lived a pretty amazing life so far. After college, I worked as a photojournalist and photo editor at two different newspapers. I’ve also worked with for profit and non-profit businesses as well.

Currently I am the manager of online advertising and analytics at Group Publishing in Loveland, Colorado.

I also run a small business called Creative Spark Columbia.
