Personal:

I’m Chip Oglesby and I’m a small business owner and former award winning photojournalist. I’m orginally from Van Wyck, SC and I currently live in Asheville, NC with my amazing wife Michelle.

I attended Mars Hill College and have lived a pretty amazing life so far. After college, I worked as a photojournalist and photo editor at two different newspapers. I’ve also worked with for profit and non-profit businesses as well.

Currently I am a data analyst at Fastpivot in Asheville, N.C. We help businesses with their online advertising, reporting and help them make data driven decisions to increase their revenue.

I also run a small business called Creative Spark Columbia.
